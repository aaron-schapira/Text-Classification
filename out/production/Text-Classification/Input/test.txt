Man ceases to be the slave and tool of his environment and converts himself into the architect of his own destiny”.

[2018-02-22 14:46:12] <tomflood737> *Tip* - frequently used Channels can be "Starred". If you click on the star button on the upper left hand side the "Star" will change to yellow. Do this for frequently used Channels as they will appear on top of the left sidebar. "Slack Always Getting Slicker" 
[2018-02-22 15:06:08] <padawa> Also on iPhone, when in the channel you want to star, click on channel name at the top and star is top right. Works a treat :star::+1::skin-tone-2: (edited)

[2018-02-22 16:35:54] <ginosabatino> This cannot be Enda. There is a profile hack here. The picture doesnt include 10 men wearing tight leather clothing standing around scooters.

[2018-02-22 17:18:52] <swfmcmanus> Is it possible to add "friends" on this? 
[2018-02-22 17:26:55] <tomflood737> Shane this is for NPA members only. If your friend is an NPA member ask them to contact their CC. You could always setup your own Slack Team and invite your friends. 
[2018-02-22 17:28:44] <swfmcmanus> I mean to add frequently contacted people to a list on the side who are already members of the RPA Slack group... 
[2018-02-22 17:36:56] <tomflood737> you can direct message up to 9 including yourself and this can be a private group. Once you start private messaging they will appear at the bottom left sidebar. So if you are talking to the same people on a regular basis this is where you find them. I'll check to see if there is any other options. 
[2018-02-22 17:42:35] <swfmcmanus> Perfect, thanks Tom 
[2018-02-22 17:47:43] <tomflood737> Also the search function makes it easy to find people once they set up their names correctly

[2018-02-22 18:01:51] <tomflood737> Brendan - you can edit messages here. one advantage you'll like over WhatsApp

[2018-02-23 00:04:18] <tomflood737> *Tip* With regard to the number of Channels that exist. There’s the option to Leave a Channel that you have no interest in. The recently converted Swap Channels would be an example, where one could tidy up the left side bar. 

Just open the Channel in question and click on the Title to open the Info box - select leave Channel if desired.  

---- 2018-02-24 ----
[2018-02-24 00:07:18] <padawa> New Channel open folks, on channels side panel click on the + sign next to "channels" and scroll to <#C9DENQM6G|12_newsroom>, click on then join :+1::skin-tone-2:

[2018-02-24 11:10:21] <padawa> Spot on Max! For clarity - on mobile devices, Names in both Full Name and Display Name should be the exact same, in the exact format as described in <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions> :+1::skin-tone-2: Plus "what I do" section should have training position and contract or if no training, just contract :+1::skin-tone-2:
