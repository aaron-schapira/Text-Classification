 [2018-02-18 14:57:07] <tomflood737> Enda is demonstrating how *not* to reply to a Topic. 
 Topics should always be replied to by opening a thread like this as opposed to starting a new Topic below. It takes a while to get used to, but essential to make the most of this platform.

 Don’t forget to include your details in the “What I do” section. Eg LTC Ryanair or Storm etc. 
 Photos are important as they will help with the overall ambitions of Unity.

 [2018-02-26 18:34:59] <andy.airamerica> I'm not sure there is a way around that Andy. For the moment its probably a good thing stuff is being shared across all bases. This way everybody gets to see it. Some people may not until they are comfortable using Slack. When people get more comfortable using this platform and know that all documents are in a specific channel then it may become unnecessary to share stuff all over the place. But for the moment its probably a good thing. (edited)

 LINE CENSORED
 [2018-02-26 19:08:14] <brendanjacobs> The document should have only been put in the relevant ma thread. The point of this is that we’re all looking into progress or updates in every base or country not just looking at our own base. If stuff is constantly duplicating like this then we won’t bother looking at any other base but our own. We’ll get used to it but the posting of the document in several places to start with, set this one off. Let’s not make the same mistake again.

 [2018-03-05 14:50:45] @andy.airamerica commented on CENSORED NAME file F9JM2MGP7: They can’t have tried very hard to reach a solution. Adjust late schedule so that all lates finish by 22:00. If arrival time is after 22:00 due unforeseen circumstances then the runway remains open for a “grace period” in order to get all aircraft back at base so as not to affect the next days earlies. Option 2: start the maintenance at 00:00 and extend it to 05:30. This is the way it is done in almost every other airport that is carrying out runway maintenance.

 [2018-03-05 17:47:00] <tomflood737> Fredrick, thanks for your post. Originally there were swap groups for every Base. We’ve chopped it back to Country and will adjust if needed per Country requirement. I’ve looked at some of the swap groups and there can be at least 30 posts about non swap issues between actual swaps. If this platform is used correctly, as in posters post a reply in “reply to thread” it may be ok as it is. 
 I realize that there’s a lot of swap activity on the FO groups as you are all suffering from zero hour contract syndrome. With Permanent jobs for all, this will be a problem of the past. 
 You are right we need everyone on here and WhatsApp to be a thing of the past.
 [2018-03-05 17:50:12] <tomflood737> A key issue about Swaps - if you post on here you’ll have a far wider audience. You may even get a swap from OOB crew, or if sent OOB, you can look for assistance OOB.

Historically more have moved to a permanent contract than the other way given the choice. I’ve always been permanent and would not change to contract unless forced.

 [2018-03-16 01:05:43] <andy.airamerica> Perhaps we should wait for guidance on this from our Company Council before people start doing the survey. What use is a Ryanair survey to us? What will we gain from it if anything? We've been telling FR for 7 month what we want. It will only serve one person and that's FR.  We all know what FR mathematics are like. Should we even trust or believe any results that come out of the survey?
