 [2018-02-26 19:08:14] <brendanjacobs> The document should have only been put in the relevant ma thread. The point of this is that we’re all looking into progress or updates in every base or country not just looking at our own base. If stuff is constantly duplicating like this then we won’t bother looking at any other base but our own. We’ll get used to it but the posting of the document in several places to start with, set this one off. Let’s not make the same mistake again.
