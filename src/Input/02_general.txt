[2018-02-15 19:16:45] <dohpau> Great setup, top mark to all involved. Are there (or will there be) restricted channels - i.e. a Channel for Company Council members that is not available to regular members?

[2018-02-18 14:11:37] <rpa> Hi Shane. Welcome bud. Have a read of the first few channels re name display and photo etc bud. Enda :+1::skin-tone-3: 
[2018-02-18 14:57:07] <tomflood737> Enda is demonstrating how *not* to reply to a Topic. 
Topics should always be replied to by opening a thread like this as opposed to starting a new Topic below. It takes a while to get used to, but essential to make the most of this platform.

[2018-02-18 15:00:04] <andy.airamerica> Slack police are going to have a busy few weeks.  
[2018-02-18 15:01:52] <tomflood737> It’ll take time, hopefully most will catch on. The beauty is you can always copy delete and paste it to the correct place if you forget.  
[2018-02-18 15:03:00] <rpa> It was intentional so that others joining would see my post  
[2018-02-18 15:04:57] <tomflood737> With you now.

[2018-02-18 15:07:16] <frankobr> Hi fellow Slackers :+1: 
[2018-02-18 16:49:52] <swfmcmanus> Is it just IALPA has this up and running or any of the other NPA?  
[2018-02-18 17:03:09] <tomflood737> We are the first to kick off. The rest will follow shortly.  
[2018-02-18 17:37:14] <swfmcmanus> Great, leading the way!!!  
[2018-02-18 22:33:25] <tomdavies737> Hi Guys, Just want to say hello and to say "anseo". Kinda reminds me of REPA without the mug shots and the creative pseudonyms. (edited)
	:blush: rpa
[2018-02-18 22:37:20] <tomflood737> Hi, Tom.
Repaweb seems like along time ago now. 
I’m very hopeful that this will provide a different outcome. It’s up to each and everyone to make it happen.  

---- 2018-02-19 ----
[2018-02-19 09:53:42] <tomflood737> Could all new members have a read of how we would like the profiles set up at <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions>. 
This will help us out with database issues in the future. 
Example
Joe Bloggs - IALPA - Capt DUB
Don’t forget to include your details in the “What I do” section. Eg LTC Ryanair or Storm etc. 
Photos are important as they will help with the overall ambitions of Unity. 

For those that have already set things up as required, thanks for your help.

Please read <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions> and edit names, photos, profiles etc exactly as requested. The reason for this is to aid with efficient search and database capabilities within slack.

[2018-02-20 10:10:47] <tomflood737> *Members Update*
To date we have 160 members signed up with another 50 odd pending acceptance. 
There are limits to invites per acceptance, so get on to your friends who’ve yet to sign up and accept the invitation. If you know of any members who have not received an invitation, please ask them to get in touch with their NPA. For Ireland it is <mailto:ifrcc@ialpa.net|ifrcc@ialpa.net>. 

Also don’t forget to check how you set up your profile. Reference instructions <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions>

 
[2018-02-20 10:15:40] <jonmillar> Think my profile is all correct now. Hello everyone.

[2018-02-20 14:25:32] <andy.airamerica> It’s there now. I had to log out and log back in before it showed up.

[2018-02-20 21:41:08] <alessandro.zanatta737> What di you mean Tom? What's that limit you are talking about?
Last but not least, I'm still not able to reply a message, I don't find the button!! 
[2018-02-20 21:47:02] <tomflood737> It’s just a restriction on members invited versus members accepting. It restricted the initial requests but I requested it to be lifted by the Slack help desk.

[2018-02-20 22:34:38] <endaryan> Folks if you click on the image you will see on the bottom “start a thread”. This is where the first person to reply to thread types. After it has been replied to once everybody else can click on the replies and it opens the “reply to thread”
So basically, to type a reply you just click on the message rather than open a new message underneath.  (edited)

[2018-02-21 00:58:39] <tomflood737> What dating Apps are those Robin.  
[2018-02-21 01:02:03] <tomflood737> It will notify you of the restriction. I think we should be ok from now on as we’ll have a steady roll of crew accepting the invites sent out.  
[2018-02-21 01:18:19] <kilroyrobin> The ones FO’s use to steal Irish maidens from innocence, your flight deck is sterile enough to have heard of no such thing I hope. But I’m afraid it’s true Tom, we both met our women by pure chance in a pub, and that makes us officially ‘old school’ to have left things to fate and random chance, whilst squandering all reasonable chance or benefit to a backdated profile pic.

[2018-02-22 14:46:12] <tomflood737> *Tip* - frequently used Channels can be "Starred". If you click on the star button on the upper left hand side the "Star" will change to yellow. Do this for frequently used Channels as they will appear on top of the left sidebar. "Slack Always Getting Slicker" 
[2018-02-22 15:06:08] <padawa> Also on iPhone, when in the channel you want to star, click on channel name at the top and star is top right. Works a treat :star::+1::skin-tone-2: (edited)

	:joy: apfoley
[2018-02-22 17:18:52] <swfmcmanus> Is it possible to add "friends" on this? 
[2018-02-22 17:26:55] <tomflood737> Shane this is for NPA members only. If your friend is an NPA member ask them to contact their CC. You could always setup your own Slack Team and invite your friends. 
[2018-02-22 17:28:44] <swfmcmanus> I mean to add frequently contacted people to a list on the side who are already members of the RPA Slack group... 
[2018-02-22 17:36:56] <tomflood737> you can direct message up to 9 including yourself and this can be a private group. Once you start private messaging they will appear at the bottom left sidebar. So if you are talking to the same people on a regular basis this is where you find them. I'll check to see if there is any other options. 
[2018-02-22 17:42:35] <swfmcmanus> Perfect, thanks Tom 
[2018-02-22 17:47:43] <tomflood737> Also the search function makes it easy to find people once they set up their names correctly

[2018-02-23 00:04:18] <tomflood737> *Tip* With regard to the number of Channels that exist. There’s the option to Leave a Channel that you have no interest in. The recently converted Swap Channels would be an example, where one could tidy up the left side bar. 

Just open the Channel in question and click on the Title to open the Info box - select leave Channel if desired.

[2018-02-26 15:30:02] <healy.michael> Don’t see any + sign beside channels just the # sign. Don’t see a channel for loss of license issues or loss of medical issues. I’m slow on IT, sorry! Am I missing something? 
[2018-02-26 18:29:37] <andyappeltans> Can someone make some guidelines about sharing stuff? Every time someone replies on the anpac letter i have to go trough 6-7 threads to clear my unreads. 
[2018-02-26 18:32:42] <padawa> Yea, those documents should just go straight into the relevant ma_ channel!  
[2018-02-26 18:33:53] <rpa> People referring to a document should use the copy link so that its not duplicating the file 
[2018-02-26 18:34:59] <andy.airamerica> I'm not sure there is a way around that Andy. For the moment its probably a good thing stuff is being shared across all bases. This way everybody gets to see it. Some people may not until they are comfortable using Slack. When people get more comfortable using this platform and know that all documents are in a specific channel then it may become unnecessary to share stuff all over the place. But for the moment its probably a good thing. (edited)
[2018-02-26 18:38:00] <rpa> Ive updated <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions> re the copy link fucntion 
[2018-02-26 18:41:50] <padawa> I'm afraid that might put people off this though, constantly reading the same thing that's been posted in every base, maybe missing out on actual new stuff, defeats the whole object of everyone having access to every channel on here. Defo the reminding about profiles etc. needs done as and when for sure, but the duplication of union material etc. could be worked on.  
	:+1: dohpau, reillyfinian
[2018-02-26 18:47:18] <swfmcmanus> It's frustrating opening and closing all the base notifications for the same document... I guess it'll calm down after a few days when people get the hang of things and everyone is on the same page as where best to put things  
[2018-02-26 18:50:18] <andy.airamerica> Precisely @swfmcmanus We are just a week into this, it will take a bit of time until we are professional Slackers. 
[2018-02-26 18:56:36] <andyappeltans> I think the problem is when you look at the document its shared in 6 base channels, the anpac and the docs channel with #...
Its not a big thing since we are all learning how this works 
[2018-02-26 19:08:14] <brendanjacobs> The document should have only been put in the relevant ma thread. The point of this is that we’re all looking into progress or updates in every base or country not just looking at our own base. If stuff is constantly duplicating like this then we won’t bother looking at any other base but our own. We’ll get used to it but the posting of the document in several places to start with, set this one off. Let’s not make the same mistake again.

[2018-02-27 07:51:46] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> So when to use the documents channel and when in the MA channel? 
[2018-02-27 07:51:56] <sam.vanherzele> The problem should be fixed as soon as everybody reads the instructions properly. An interim solution: you can ‘mute’ channels by clicking the gear icon inside each channel. You will still be able to read everything, but you will not receive notifications and it will not display in your ‘unread’ lists anymore :stuck_out_tongue: 
[2018-02-27 10:25:52] <peter_mcdonough> Is there anyway to indicate unread messages alongside each channel in the channel list similar to WhatsApp? 
[2018-02-27 10:30:37] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> They should be in bold, white. Or do you mean the amount of unread messages? 
[2018-02-27 10:31:46] <peter_mcdonough> Just noticed that now thanks! New to slack 
[2018-02-27 10:45:21] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> :+1: 
[2018-02-27 11:53:47] <padawa> Documents is a 'read only' channel so there shouldn't be any comments, the ma channel is for all ma related queries etc. so post and comment away, keeps it tidy for everyone, all ma associated material and questions and answers in the one place :+1::skin-tone-2: (edited)
[2018-02-27 11:56:27] <padawa> If people post duplicate messages in all bases of a country for example it will clog up everyone's slack with notifications and will make this tool less effective :+1::skin-tone-2: 
[2018-02-27 12:01:17] <padawa> Think I've worked out that when there's a new post it will show up in bold white on the channels list and then the All Threads at the top of the channels list will show all replies to posts that you have started or commented in. Still to work out tho if the bold white shows up for replies in general or just 'New posts', if that makes sense?   
[2018-02-27 12:02:28] <padawa> The 'All Threads' is great tho because it shows all new replies etc. to all your conversations in the one place!  
[2018-02-27 18:00:12] <kilroyrobin> A direct message or @peter_mcdonough should generate a red dot I believe.  
[2018-02-27 18:03:21] <peter_mcdonough> @kilroyrobin it does indeed, thanks!

[2018-03-04 22:33:16] <kilroyrobin> THE SURVIVOR

Back in September everyone in this airline was walking down the street minding their own business. Suddenly someone realised the homeless body on the pavement was still alive.

We all rushed to the rescue, hundreds of selfless acts of bravery and determination got the old and feeble survivor on to the operating table before it was too late. As those that cared for him nursed him back to health the wise old character made a quick recovery, some of the older lads even knew his face. His name was Unity.

By December his voice could be heard far and wide, he spoke firmly, determination and wisdom in his every word, people believed and people knew he was right. Even Ryanair knew he was right, but although they turned around to the table of reason they still sat scoffing in the corner. Old habits die hard. With a sneer they played a few tricks, but he was in full recovery and it was too late. We all know the last laugh can belong to Unity - if he lives.

Just remember this though - when we rushed in and brought Unity back to life we had to save the whole man or loose his soul. Saving one little piece was no good. We must save the whole of our strength and never have it divided.

Looking after anything less than every country together is akin to putting the defibrillator on to just one limb in an attempt to save that bit for yourself. Useless. 

Death peers down at old Unity from a glassy office window on high, the Angel of greed circles like a buzzard, nearby she plays a sickening tune upon a heartless harp of gold. They both wait eagerly for Unity to fall upon that very sword. 

We save the whole damn lot or we save nothing. One for all and all for one might sound like a catch phrase, but in this case its the raw fact and soul of the matter. 

Remember that street we were on back before September is a cul-de-sac. A dead end.

[2018-03-05 14:50:45] @andy.airamerica commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: They can’t have tried very hard to reach a solution. Adjust late schedule so that all lates finish by 22:00. If arrival time is after 22:00 due unforeseen circumstances then the runway remains open for a “grace period” in order to get all aircraft back at base so as not to affect the next days earlies. Option 2: start the maintenance at 00:00 and extend it to 05:30. This is the way it is done in almost every other airport that is carrying out runway maintenance. 
[2018-03-05 15:00:38] @joshgoodacre commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: Baby is due end of March, now they've dumped this on us

[2018-03-05 15:21:15] <christianklaeren> What is the deadline? 
[2018-03-05 15:26:17] @christianklaeren commented on @opurrys file F9JM2MGP7: Questions which come to my mind:

1. Did they go to meetings and try to establish together with other airlines better times. Ryanair is not the only one affected. 

2. Did they consider alternate island airports like TFN?

3. Is it maybe in their favor to free up pilot capacities to fill gaps elsewhere?

4. Sounds like a political game between AENA and Ryanair. 
[2018-03-05 15:54:15] @andy.airamerica commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: I'll wager its 3.

[2018-03-05 17:17:52] <fredrikallex> Hello all! Great platform we’ve got going here!

Admin, small suggestion, it may be an idea to create separate captain/fo swap groups for each base to keep swaps more relevant for each user. This might help replace whatsapp based swap groups:) 
[2018-03-05 17:45:20] <andyappeltans> This has been discussed before and they are looking into it 
[2018-03-05 17:47:00] <tomflood737> Fredrick, thanks for your post. Originally there were swap groups for every Base. We’ve chopped it back to Country and will adjust if needed per Country requirement. I’ve looked at some of the swap groups and there can be at least 30 posts about non swap issues between actual swaps. If this platform is used correctly, as in posters post a reply in “reply to thread” it may be ok as it is. 

I realize that there’s a lot of swap activity on the FO groups as you are all suffering from zero hour contract syndrome. With Permanent jobs for all, this will be a problem of the past. 

You are right we need everyone on here and WhatsApp to be a thing of the past. 
[2018-03-05 17:50:12] <tomflood737> A key issue about Swaps - if you post on here you’ll have a far wider audience. You may even get a swap from OOB crew, or if sent OOB, you can look for assistance OOB.  
	:+1::skin-tone-3: swfmcmanus
[2018-03-05 18:18:57] <inglo> How about a group for people in notice period and ex ryanair jockeys? With our turnover of crews that might be filling up fast :slightly_smiling_face: 
	:joy: damiano.detomassi, fredrikallex
[2018-03-05 18:28:43] <fredrikallex> I see, there are definitely a lot of advantages with using slack for swaps! 

I was just thinking it might be easier for them to convert if there was an equivalent /replacement to our current dedicated FO swap group. The goal here being to eventually close the whatsapp group.

Maybe the best solution would be to have swap threads based on country and rank. An OOB captain in DUB from STN can then use the Ireland CPT swap group for example. This ensures the chat is both relevant for the user and accessible to a wider (OOB) audience.

 
[2018-03-05 18:45:12] <padawa> Just had this forwarded.....Probably should be in Ryanair Mathematics 101, or Royal cock ups :face_with_rolling_eyes:....

Here’s a story: Edinburgh to canaries flight today, develops tech problem, 1hr to fix. Ops advises a/c change. A/c No. 2 fuelled up and crew go straight to it, paperwork brought out etc etc. On arrival crew find out it’s a 72T a/c rather than the usual 75T MTOW... aaaaand with 17T fuel they’re overweight. A/c change back to a/c No.1 and depart with delay. 

Now Ops need to de-fuel a/c No2 as it’s overweight to do any flight that’s more than 3/4 full with pax... apparently it can’t be done as two Capts have been called off standby to go flying to spend a couple of hours burning off fuel! Never mind there’s a fuel shortage in Edi due to the weather :grimacing:

[2018-03-12 14:53:03] @kilroyrobin commented on @kilroyrobin’s file F9MRMBJU9: On the road this morning I noticed this truck. It reminded me of a certain highly efficient low cost carrier model we keep being told about. Due to a significant shift in the position held by its constituent parts however it has become untenable in all but the tamest conditions imaginable. Certainly in its current form it is not competitive. Management drive on regardless though. They won’t pull over. They never pull over, they don’t pay people to hang around. Meanwhile the unions are at the wheel of the forklift that ultimately can fix the whole show, just as long as they are allowed to get to work before the driver rolls the whole damn thing.

I have my P60. 
[2018-03-12 20:49:03] <damiano.detomassi> Problem is 148209-48% becomes a second class Cpt salary . Why 48%? Cause they can’t figure out we pay in 2 different countries (apart from Irish Crew ) without any possible deduction . 
[2018-03-12 20:53:22] <masterharkin> Worse for us in Ireland :flag-ie:.  40% income tax, 4% national insurance &amp; 8% universal social charge. Total 52% Tax. 
[2018-03-12 20:56:09] <kilroyrobin> Yes I was just thinking the same thing. We are paying for our Sins - apparently.  
[2018-03-12 21:23:15] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> I'm paying "only" 5,8% USC (yes, we pay that as well!). Is it maybe 8%, but capped? 
I'm paying 10,2% over my full salary in social premiums; that's a whopping 13,3k!
And 40% income tax it not over your full salary. How much is your total tax paid devided by total income (before pension deductions, if any)? In Germany it's 48% over full income. 
[2018-03-12 21:24:01] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Anyway, happy to fund Volkswagen's fuckup, and the 150M to Air Berlin, and 4bn to a still-not-opened BER airport.... 
[2018-03-12 21:29:55] <damiano.detomassi> In any country the social charges take away taxable income . So 148200-12% social will become 130000 taxable , while with the current system it’s all separate entities. A normal pilot of a normally locally contracted airline will get a total deduction of tax and social of about 28-35% , we get 48-50% making any gross salary generous offer become ...shameful .  in their wisdom Europeans countries tough  about double tax treaties but not double tax / social mix treaties for Irish multinational airline employees based everywhere like us . We should start lobbying maybe ?  (edited)
[2018-03-12 23:06:16] <jgrooney> Any government is a collection activist for the global commercial elite corporations who run modern society . Power allowance is not linear , it’s vertical . Any commercial operator under that government in any country that creates employment and deducts taxes for it is a good compliant servant of the financial elite  . Therefore , we are only compliant employees that only see a tiny fraction of the benefits of loosing income to taxes . I agree..... time to stop lobbying as the higher tax payers of the new proletariat ...... namely middle class .

[2018-03-13 18:59:11] <tomflood737> Nils, it’s always going to be a personal choice. If you are doing all by the book and not involved in tax evasion, it’s better on the permanent contract imho. Historically more have moved to a permanent contract than the other way given the choice. I’ve always been permanent and would not change to contract unless forced.

---- 2018-03-16 ----
[2018-03-16 01:05:43] <andy.airamerica> Perhaps we should wait for guidance on this from our Company Council before people start doing the survey. What use is a Ryanair survey to us? What will we gain from it if anything? We've been telling FR for 7 month what we want. It will only serve one person and that's FR.  We all know what FR mathematics are like. Should we even trust or believe any results that come out of the survey? 
[2018-03-16 03:30:02] <healy.michael>  My initial reaction to P Bellew fishing for information from survey...don’t do their work for them. Whatever the survey is for, be assured it is not for your benefit. 
[2018-03-16 06:46:10] <swfmcmanus> I take it as an opportunity to inform them from as many people across the network about their experiences and frustrations to date. It can be as mild as printers not working in crewrooms to how you've been screwed over with leave, base transfers last minute OOB etc. Even if they don't care about what's said in the survey and fiddle the results at least you'll have said your piece.

[2018-03-16 19:15:07] <jgrooney> With respect to all , I agree with Andy ( to see what the RYRCC say ) and with Michael . Mngt have created and fed so much distrust by now that I fear the survey is  a tactic to spin a communication to shareholders and press - outsiders , that they are actively engaging with the crew body on a regular basis . Nothing will be done as Any improvements mean cash outflow , which Mngt and shareholders ( i.e some mngt) hate . Too many holes in the dam . #fed up now as part of the pilot body trying to save the dam when they keep increasing the water levels .  
[2018-03-16 21:06:48] <andy.airamerica> Excellent analogy there. They say a rising tide raises all ships. Well unfortunately the ryanair ship just has too many holes in it at the moment and not enough people have any fingers left to plug them.

The Captain reads the weather and then says:- 

"So I thought we could take some fuel for wind sheer, its gusting over 40”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"I thought we could change the alternate too as this one is out of limits, and we can take a bit of holding too, it’s a busy international airport, what do you think”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"so thats original block 6.6, .4 for the change of alternate, .8 for wind sheer go around, 1.2 for holding which is 8 tonnes, happy?”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"Oh wait, my mistake, that’s actually 9 tonnes”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"are you ready for a brief?”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"…the emergency turn is turn right at 3.7 DME, left turn, back to the NDB, enter the hold 248 inbound right turns, happy with that?”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

and later

"Clear to start 2?”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

“one to go”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of PF's head as he fills in EFL)

“So thats the FRISC, Approach checks please"
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

“gear down”
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees FO’s face for the first time.)

After landing, "I have control"
“yep” 
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

Captain blames FO for this?

[2018-03-22 13:27:26] <daithi50> Just to add to the conversation about flying skills. 

I keep myself current by flying manually as much as I can to always be in a position to be able to handle the aircraft if needed. Today our aircraft DLJ gave us both cause for concern. 

On 3 departures today with A/P engaged and flaps up, once it reaches the up speed it violently pitches up past 15degrees rapidly causing the speed to decrease to around 185 to 190 kts and showing a very worrying speed trend downwards. The first time it happened with FO as PF I had to disconnect it quickly to shove the nose down to arrest the speed. I took maybe 1 second to disconnect it which resolved the issue. I have no doubt that if the A/P remained engaged there would have been a stall warner in a matter of seconds. If someone is in any way reluctant or hesitant in that situation they could find themselves in a trouble quick. 

I was desperate to talk to the crew taking the plane from us just Incase engineers ran a test and it said no fault found. I didn’t want a 100 hour captain and a 100hour FO taking the plane. I am fully sure that we should be encouraged to disconnect whenever we see fit and as we he situation warrants and not maximum use of the A/P regularly which turns us all into trained monkeys. By the way my FO was a very competent 200 hour guy with very good flying skills.

[2018-03-23 21:48:41] <oliver> What is the “policy” about WOFF? It seems in BGY many people do it regularly.

Also what is the EERC suggestion about small bases being lured into accepting the new deal..... just because new hires are getting it automatically and the old guys dont want to be treated as second grade by this RYR policy? 
Would this in any way render the CLA negotiation more difficult?
I seem to have read that EERC was ok with signing the new deal temporary, as this would not influence the CLA.
I think there is some missunderstanding about this around the network. 
[2018-03-23 22:12:11] <christianklaeren> I think it is pretty clear what helps our case and what does not! Flying on WOFF takes away pressure from the company. Up to you if you want us with sharp teeth for negotiations or if you want us to enter negotiations without teeth and then have less negotiation power...pretty logic I would have thought... (edited)
[2018-03-23 22:12:41] <paul> IMO working days off in the present situation is like enabling an addict, which is why I don't do it. I'd encourage anyone else who has worked a day off or who would consider doing so to first think about what message it sends and what it achieves papering over the cracks without fixing the real problems. 
[2018-03-23 22:34:43] <tomflood737> In Ireland asking members to not work their days off would be considered illegal without having a ballot for industrial action. 

This all takes time and valuable resources, 

Ryanair is big on efficiency, and we are Ryanair Pilots. (edited)

[2018-03-24 00:00:47] <oliver> Christian, thanks for your answer, and I was not speaking about me, as I am not volounteering my days off, for various reason, but because it seems alot of guys are doing it..... this is why I brought it up.
What about guys pushing to sign the “goodies” deal, before the CLA? I have heard guys in small bases asking advice about that.
BGY was probably the only base that didnt even put it up for a vote, we all refused for solidariety.... but smaller bases are more susceptable. 
[2018-03-24 00:18:56] @bertstaelens commented on @iglehane’s file F9V6LESPN: Well if people signed the new “deal” then i’m not suprised they also fly on days off to help out the company and release some pressure... i hope they enjoy the extra cash and sleep well while their colleagues fight for a much better future...

Means you gonna take the flights from your colleagues not working on days off and they will be on sbys instead. As Andy said, next week you’ll be on sby anyway. Nothing to win... ah yeah extra money, this is called dirty money... 
[2018-03-24 06:52:03] @brendanjacobs commented on @iglehane’s file F9V6LESPN: 100% Damien. That one easy two sector day that pops up on your roster in the midst of horrible long 4 sector days. Your little ‘rest’ in the middle of the week. Now taken by a colleague just for a little extra cash. That Standby they give you in return, will become some horrible positioning flight that’ll eventually have you sitting for hours waiting for the last flight home. You’ll earn 3hrs sector pay for a 16hr day. Meanwhile your ‘colleague’ has already finished YOUR easy day, sitting on the sofa counting his extra penny’s. Sound!
[2018-03-24 06:55:11] <masterharkin> We are doing Ryanair as a company no favours by working off days. This is simply putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. This patient is so seriously injured that it now needs surgery. As soon as it rains that band-aid is going to fall off. Let’s bring this patient to hospital where we can fix it forever. The vehicle for that trip is going to be the cancellations ambulance.
Cancellations = CLA = Recovery

[2018-03-24 09:21:13] <damiano.detomassi> Yes but how many new pilots Bergamo had in the last few months and will have till November ? From Berlin we lost 5 to Bergamo alone.  All new dealers and all no union yet as transfers  
[2018-03-24 09:37:27] @andy.airamerica commented on @iglehane’s file F9V6LESPN: @damien.duflou sums this memo up brilliantly. This memo confirms the company will be relying on people working days off in order to create standby cover. Several issues with this. 1) 7 months ago the company claimed they had a “rostering debacle” because they had insufficient standby cover because of pilots taking leave. 7 months later NOTHING HAS CHANGED!!! 2) this method of running the schedule is SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE. The company admitted as much in a previous memo when they promised “this will not happen again”. 3) these standbys being created by people working days off are probably being used to cover multiple bases because For example: you’re on standby in DUB but you are actually covering a standby in SNN or ORK. On standby in PIK but you’re covering EDI standby. Phone rings on standby in BCN. Jump in a taxi(you pay for!) and get to GRO as soon as possible. DO YOU WANT THAT PHONE CALL? Work your day off and then listen to your colleague in the crewroom describe how he/she was called off standby and told to get to the airport ASAP to position for an overnight. I could go on and on here about how I feel about this but I’ll just put some of these :rage::rage::rage::rage::rage::rage::rage::rage::rage:

Although very tempting, working days off just prolongs the agony and delays the process whereby we achieve reasonable t&amp;c’s and a just and fair Culture in Ryanair. It is working against the objectives of your Company Council &amp; Pilot Association and undermines your colleagues. Each and everyone of us around the Ryanair network will find ourselves under pressure to work days off coming into the Summer season. Please resist. It’s the least you can do for your colleagues.

Please use exact format as follows “Joe Pilot - IALPA - Capt DUB” “Joe Pilot - IALPA - FO DUB”.  If you have been sent an invite, this will be pre-populated in your name field, just copy and paste to DISPLAY NAME field.

RPA slack for dummies ( which is all of us at the beginning ) :sunglasses: would explain as follows.. 
*Joe Pilot space dash space IALPA space dash space Capt DUB*

Training ranks and contract status should be inserted in the role tab on edit profile.

Constantly connected to the social pipeline and with it brings its challenges but more importantly exposure. While having information and the ability to share this info instantly at our finger tips is beneficial, it can be all too tempting to abuse it. I ask that when we all contribute on Slack that we do so in a respectful way to each other. Use appropriate language. Do not post accusations based on a rumor especially if it specifically names or visually identifies an individual. Our profession demands our upmost commitment to professionalism. Do not post offensive images. A joke may be funny to you but may offend the wrong people. Be responsible and be willing to stand by anything you post if challenged. You are responsible for what you post here and it reflects on you as an individual. Don’t give anybody the ammunition they need to question you. Before you post something ask yourself is it helpful. Will it contribute to the conversation. 

Thanks. 
In the end not so short :joy: sorry about that.

[2018-04-01 00:43:28] <paul> I suspect given the recognition deal that the ANPAC council signed, you'd be best off issuing solidarity badges and statements _against_ them... 
[2018-04-01 01:06:45] <christianklaeren> @paul could you explain what you mean by your statement?! The recognition letter signed by @alessandro.zanatta737 and Anpac is based on a recognition letter suggested by Ireland. Italy would not have needed it! We went ahead with it as the first of this initiative and in the common European spirit!  
[2018-04-01 05:22:44] <brendanjacobs> Suggested by Ireland, as in Ryanair? I’m confused. 
[2018-04-01 05:38:48] <brendanjacobs> Paul, it’s important we all stick together here, for the common goal! If anyone has any concerns about the direction/strategy being employed by their Union, it would be best to contact your company council and air your concerns. It is after all YOUR Union and company council. Open debate on here is obviously a good thing, provided it’s constructive. :wink:

[2018-04-01 08:10:09] <andy.airamerica> @christianklaeren  If you are somehow suggesting the Irish CC wrote your recognition agreement for you and told you to send it to Ryanair for approval then you are gravely mistaken. If I have understood you incorrectly I apologize but that’s how what you typed comes across.

Any update on the Portuguese Strikes.  
[2018-04-01 10:40:18] <tomflood737> Reply here 
[2018-04-01 10:48:02] <osmo.kleemola> Apparently a lot of planes left empty with pilots only in the morning. Those flights aren't shown on the cancellations and passengers are very confused. 
[2018-04-01 10:49:29] <dohpau> My understanding is that more cabin crew are on strike today than the previous strike day. 
	:+1: andy.airamerica, ginosabatino, kj.verachtert, padawa
[2018-04-01 10:52:40] <tomflood737>  Probably doing some kind of reverse rotation and picking up crew at the destination.  
[2018-04-01 11:04:45] <bertstaelens> Crew from crl is DH to FAO to opperate FAO to MAN and MAN to FAO, then overnight in FAO. From the crl base facebook page 
[2018-04-01 11:14:49] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> We urgently need to establish what is legal and what is illegal regarding strike breaking. CC in Germany are finding thier off days (!) changed in standby on the 04-04, fearing they will have to do reverse rostering. 
Above example from @bertstaelens might also be illegal under Portugese law. 
@dohpau can SPAC advise? 
[2018-04-01 11:23:45] <dohpau> Reference is "Codigo do Trabalho" Article 535. Cabin Crew outside of Portugal should ask their local union to contact SNPVAC and have them make a recommendation together. 
[2018-04-01 11:26:58] <christianklaeren> @brendanjacobs @andy.airamerica To avoid misunderstanding the letter was derived based on an Irish document and modified for Italy by us and then put up during the negotiation process. Obviously the company did want to put in their part which they did and we managed to negotiate away in big parts what was not acceptable for us. We subsequently shared the recognition for transparency and because we wanted to share it. All European company council learned from this and we know now how the company looks at something which one country does and what they pretend based on this for all. Who is involved in negotiations knows they are very dynamic and fast changing at times. We in Italy do our part for our pilots in Italy and supporting our European colleagues.  
[2018-04-01 11:29:14] <christianklaeren> @johan As a person I fully agree with you. Everyone should do what he feels like doing. What he thinks is the right thing to do!

[2018-04-01 11:48:57] <christianklaeren> @oliver Hello Oliver, it is me again answering to you, all from the other end of Italy, from the south, from Sicily, despite the direct contacts in base you have in BGY. 
Like many unions, also Anpac is a member of IFALPA where they communicate and express themselves. In case one country needs support letters these are coordinated through there I have been told. For the rest, since a strike is a strong tool, it is also very political and that means those who can organize strikes (unions) have to move careful for not getting burnt in something which lots of individual private person support by all means but a statement made by a union could be of negative impact. Every country has its own laws, rules and issues regarding unions, strikes and communication. 
Regarding the meeting in BGY and subsequent meetings, they will be rescheduled as soon as possible after one colleague from Anpac is fit again. Sorry for this inconvenience but not foreseeable at all.

[2018-04-01 11:57:41] <paul> Christian sorry if my comment came across too critical - I'm sure you're doing a lot of unpaid work for your colleagues just like all the other union representatives. It's hard to convey humorous exaggeration in text so probably I should have phrased what I said differently. My point was I think the recognition agreement signed by ANPAC is a bad deal for the company council and the Italy based pilots, I've met a number of colleagues who agree. Regardless I hope we'll see a good CLA negotiated in Italy and wish you all the best.

	:+1: andy.airamerica
[2018-04-01 13:34:10] <oliver> Thanks Christian for your reply, as always stated, I do appreciate all your efforts. Believe me I do.
You should welcome and expect questions from your fellow pilots.... did I read a hint of boredom from you having to answer my concerns again? “Oliver it is me again answering”... if not my apologies. The fact that we pose more questions than normally necessary is probably a direct consequence of the secrecy the italian union and CC decided to adopt, towards their fellow italian based pilots.
Maybe its because I am used of the direct democracy we have in Switzerland, but I love to be active in politics and to help shape and vote on issues concerning all of us, instead of simply vote a party or polititian and let him/them do the whole work, while keeping their constituences in the dark. 
[2018-04-01 13:51:11] <christianklaeren> Hi Oliver, there is no boredom, that was more an ironic hint for my fellow CC who leave it to me to do the “public relation” work. I just heard you are now in MXP based. @sam.vanherzele is your direct contact there, at next opportunity maybe invite him for a coffee and have a chat on all the open points you might have.  
For the rest, Anpac nor we CC are not a secret assembly, you can write here, email us and get informed here and through newsletter. Please do not state you are not being informed. That not all the things, at all the times can be told, was already lenghtly discussed, so I will not repeat it again. 

I appreciate you want to actively take part. It would have been great if we would have had you as ERC and subsequently as CC. 
Maybe in the future we can arrange this task for you, if you have the willing and time for it. 

Have a nice Happy Easter (edited)

[2018-04-05 08:27:28] <oliver> Did Anpac change its position about portuguese strike? I see their logo on this letter.
Are we now officially approved to show solidariety? 
[2018-04-05 09:39:21] <sam.vanherzele> Hi Oliver, you have always been allowed to show solidarity, no-one is stopping you. There is however a difference between showing solidarity and refusing to work. As per current guidance, as an Italian based crewmember, we can not refuse to perform flights outside of Italy (ref ANPAC memo 07/12/17 regarding ‘main engagement rules’ during Italian strikes).
Clarification is being sought on a European level about ‘replacing strike workers’. We will post on slack as soon as we have an update on this. 
[2018-04-05 09:45:30] <oliver> Hi Sam, what I meant was that Anpac was not showing official solidarity until yesterday. It is a good think that they are doing it now, its a sign of international brotherhood unity.

[2018-04-09 11:22:34] <kilroyrobin> After a fair few years in Line training I have seen more than a few students who have come and gone. Mostly Gone. I recently met one of my original Type rating colleagues and we shook hands over a few more wrinkles than we started with, we couldn't think of anyone else in our group who was still here, but now a change has come. As I have said before I don't use Instructor time to talk about Union work because a Pilot should make up their own free mind at a time when I don't have power over their progression, but this year I notice students freely choose to use the quiet patch in the last cruise home on sector 4, where it's too late to learn any more and time to consolidate what you know already, to speculate with pride about the results of their own part in the Union, I've had several lately, both Cadets and Commanders, who were people with the vision to stay, but only after they make it a place to stay for. Unity it seems will instruct its own student in the very best order of any instructor. By example. (edited)

[2018-04-10 23:14:59] <bertstaelens> Also remember that if you record a call you need to inform the other person on the line, this is a legal requirement in many country’s.

[2018-04-11 04:45:54] <derekfdoyle> It’s not a requirement in Ireland and Ryanair insists that Irish law applies. You cannot record third party calls.  Has crew control ever told you that they record all calls? 
[2018-04-11 06:48:55] <garethglennon> When you call crew control it says calls may be recorded! I suppose that covers you when they call!  
[2018-04-11 07:06:03] <luek-b> And also : it’s probably a requirement if you want to use it in court. But if you just leak it to the media like it happened with the Spanish cabin crew . . .

[2018-04-11 18:43:12] <tomflood737> If the 10000 message is reached, older messages will drop off. They can be retrieved if people decide to pay. But it would be expensive if all were to subscribe.

[2018-04-12 03:36:21] <padawa> Does everyone that uses slack have to subscribe or can the admins that set up the this RPA workspace able to subscribe to cover the individual workspace under one umbrella? If that makes sense? Not sure how it works! Is so, might help with being able to send more invites and message limits etc. if this was the case? We could all chip in a few quid! 
[2018-04-12 06:39:21] <tomflood737> We would have to pay per member. One account to upgrade.  
[2018-04-12 11:49:31] <danieltierney1> During a conversation with an engineer a couple of days ago, he mentioned to me his concern for the fact that a large number of very experienced engineers have been leaving the company recently and are being continuously replaced with inexperienced and in some situations, unsuitable people. Said it made him feel very uneasy about the whole situation. 
Continuous erosion of experience and skill in all departments is what we're dealing with here. It has to stop! 
[2018-04-12 11:51:06] <damiano.detomassi> Absolutely . Same experienced we have in Germany , contractors engineers coming from across the border for a week , then never seen them again. We need to keep an eye on every maint they make as the failure will re occur at the first flight after . We keep having HILs open and less and less time to fix it  
[2018-04-12 12:52:37] <ginosabatino> This is clear when you look at the amount of times despatching now with HILs Vs a few years ago... 
[2018-04-12 12:55:43] <nilsholdrinet> The only thing we can do about this is succeed in changing the culture within the company. Otherwise this will never end. 
[2018-04-12 13:02:10] <damiano.detomassi> Agreed, and unfortunately quickly  signing deal to get 700 Euros more net or maybe a share of the glory won’t act at changing the low cost at all cost mentality that is prevailing right now . It’s a cultural change so maybe painfully but surely a management change . 
	:100: mischa_buijs
[2018-04-12 13:05:05] <nilsholdrinet> "Low cost at all cost", that's one of the most apt descriptions of the company culture I've come across. Something to remember for when we go to the roundabout :muscle:.

[2018-04-12 16:53:16] <marconania> Quick consideration:

What does the company need to be able to cover their summer schedule? 
Hiring more pilots (mainly cpts) and upgrading the experienced fo to cover their flights..

this thing really drives me crazy, why the hell would so many people want to become a trainer, examiner, bc etc. in this delicate times??? This way you are helping them to solve the problem...

That’s fuckin non sense in my opinion, specially considering how little they will pay these guys for such a hard job!

If it is a matter of money, in my opinion it is preferable to do a woff instead of selling your soul to the company training your own replacement. If instead it is a matter of showing your mum/girlfriend how good you are then it is even more disappointing...

Forgive me if I offended anyone but I had to say it!

 
[2018-04-12 16:59:55] <peterw.mulder> You’re absolutely right! However the exact same thing can be said for FOs upgrading. Or for people working days off. Or even for guys accepting a base change to the base they want! Try and keep the bigger picture in this! Ryanair is focussed on only 1 thing. And that is to divide and conquer. By commenting on your colleagues like that, you’re dividing us even before Ryanair has said a word. And believe me, people will realise what is right and what is wrong. Unfortunately we are only people, and the majority will always think of themselves first... Stay positive and keep looking ahead. Try and talk to your colleagues that you are worried about and explain to them what we are trying to achieve with unity. That’s all we can do, don’t blame someone for an upgrade or career opportunity, but rather lecture them on the benefits of standing together! :facepunch:

[2018-04-12 18:01:23] <robertwasilewski> I am using the "Call recorder" for Android, it was working great until the last week, however last time I got a call from the CC and I was unable to hear them anymore. Looks like they are using some counter measures... 
[2018-04-12 18:15:58] <marconania> You are completely right under every aspect, but it is really disappointing to see people who were saying bad things about who was doing woff to apply for training positions... Specially if you consider that in Italy we refused the new deal but getting a new position makes you sign the new contract for what I understand. Please correct me if I’m wrong  
[2018-04-12 18:16:58] <derekfdoyle> The call recorder is still working ok for me.  If anyone is using a Lightspeed Zulu 3 headset, any phone can be connected to it and calls can be recorded by the headset.  Useful during working hours and it works with iPhones. 
[2018-04-12 18:38:09] <tuhhodge> The unity we achieved in the winter was not forged by people who left the company nor hindered by those who worked days off or training. It was achieved by all remaining line pilots working altogether. Some of the most active people in the old RPG, in BALPA and IALPA long before it became fashionable were or are trainers with a vested interest in the high standards we all strive to meet irrespective of the pressure put on us by the company.

[2018-04-12 18:49:43] <marconania> Huge respect to the ones who train because I think it is an extremely demanding job, I was just thinking about who applies now. I know it is really temping but should we resist and wait a couple of months before going for those positions?

[2018-04-12 19:19:21] <damiano.detomassi> I tend to agree with Marco . Personally remained on the line and at my base to avoid change in the contract , and most of my base the same we are at -20ryanair% but happy to be doing them no favors . 
[2018-04-12 22:08:21] <kilroyrobin> This is a great example of what engaged conversation can do. In my opinion you guys all nailed the correct points that lead any thinking pilot to the correct answers in this strand. And I say answers (plural) because your route to your destination depends on where you begin from.  
[2018-04-12 23:32:44] <jgrooney> As Richard Branson reiterates every few weeks on various sites .... Train your staff good enough that they can leave ... but treat them good enough that they won’t want to ...... simple . Mngt forget this . They want it that we are not part of the company , only annoying suppliers of a necessary service via licenses etc . They manage the company not us . Therein sets worthlessness as Robin said . We deserve the right to protect this great company of not assets such as aircraft etc but GREAT PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE” doing their best . No wonder the great personnel in training are fed up. Line captains are fed up flying with new guys asking loads of questions and soaking experience on each sector and then say they only want to get to 500 hours so they can go to an already set up position with another airline !!! What is going on ??? Are mngt respecting staff that want to stay by asking them what’s going on ??? :thinking_face::-1:

[2018-04-13 19:19:40] <tomflood737> *A good habit we should develop is the give your new topic a header title in bold.*
Put a * before and after the text to make it bold. 

After posting open up the first thread reply, “stating please reply here”. This will prompt the next person to click the blue “reply” prompt and hopefully the message will spread. Also, if uploading a file, we should refrain from adding a big long winded text caption to it. If you want to add a big long comment open a Topic directly below, as stated above. This will make it easier for others to comment, instead of adding another big long caption reply. If that all makes sense. 
 
[2018-04-13 19:24:57] <kilroyrobin> how come this had a *reply* box open under it, but you had no reply entered? 
[2018-04-13 19:32:27] <tomflood737> No sure of the question. I was just replying to a topic that already had a tread running.

[2018-04-14 21:15:32] <johan> You're absolutely right Oliver. People need to consult their unions before accepting something like this. And people like you, with expert knowledge in technical subjects (this counts), need to volunteer to the union in order to assist those who come seeking help. That's unity!

[2018-04-19 09:33:20] <boswellbrown> I made the point last year to Ray about 25 min being for a 73-200 and possibly 300/400’s when we had them. I added that FR always claimed we could do 25min because no allocated seating.... well guess what’s changed! “That’s what we have to work with” was his response. 
[2018-04-19 10:13:42] <nilsholdrinet> As expected, it's Ryanair SOP to keep doing something until it's not sustainable anymore. And when it all comes crashing down (like last September), they'll do some quick fixes, incomplete fixes and call it done.

On the face of it there seemed little to fear, but there was. Things turned for the worse, a snow storm blew in the likes of which hasn’t been seen in a very long time. There are many storms here, but this one seemed to take the worst of all the others and condense it down to a very destructive combination of elements, a new low. We were not prepared, and it was. It flattened the whole crop and for a while nothing could even grew on the scorched earth. Undeterred some are busily preparating the ground and sowing the seeds of a better return. It’s not certain exactly what the summer will bring, but one thing seems sure. What is being planted today will grow and grow. What lies ahead will be better than that most heartless winter which now lies in our past, it’s sole purpose now being a lesson to the Little boy who watches on, and every one before him too. That storm couldn’t send a chill through us now, not even if it tried.

[2018-04-26 09:20:59] <nilsholdrinet> *Interactive Duty Plan*

With the introduction of the new eCrew App functionality of Interactive Duty Plan (IDP) and it now being the primary method of viewing and accepting duty changes (according to the memo of 25/4), I feel there is a threat the company has gotten a new avenue/tool to potentially circumvent FTLs/Rest.

They need you for a flight that's earlier than your stby? _Ah we changed that yesterday, you should have checked your IDP._ Need you to start earlier than your original duty, same story. 

Perhaps I'm being pessimistic but it seems like this is a massive change in our communication with the company without a robust set of rules on how to govern it. 
[2018-04-26 09:29:50] <andyappeltans> There should also be a text message and if we don't confirm the change crew controll should still call us. So in my eyes i don't see much changing with ftls 
[2018-04-26 09:42:01] <masterharkin> It shows there is zero intent to increase staffing levels in any department. The more they can get you to do and self certify using an App on your iPad then the less staff they need in crew-control. Staff cost extra money, you don’t. You will continue to do more and more for FREE.

[2018-04-26 09:42:36] <andyappeltans> Next step wipl be the recurrent training on x-plane 
	:thinking_face: swfmcmanus
[2018-04-26 09:45:20] <noelintogher> I think Nils is correct on this one. It is being introduced by stealth. A new memo will come out in a while telling us to check ipad before you go to bed to see what you are doing the next morning. In saying that at the moment  you are not required to check ipad, SMS, email, voicemail or missed calls on off days or rest time. That’s why we have a roster on a Friday! 
	:point_up: andy.airamerica
[2018-04-26 10:08:30] <fergus.cassidy> Make sure sms notification is turned off. 
[2018-04-26 10:10:20] <swfmcmanus> You can't view it unless you read your compulsory reads, this works on 3G via the app... But it's not possible to confirm you read and understand so the whole thing is pointless unless you have wifi to do it via safari 
[2018-04-26 10:36:07] <jessica.emurphy2009> I agree with Nils 
[2018-04-26 11:50:54] <eric.hulsinga> Agree with Shane, you can’t do anything unless you read the propaganda first. And why is showing local and utc times helpful? It’s freaking confusing! (edited)
[2018-04-26 12:05:32] <tuhhodge> I don't see a big problem. The intention is that changes in the active week will require a confirmation from you, just as is currently the case. If you don't do it, they'll send a text, if nothing by the day before, they'll call. Not really much difference? 
[2018-04-26 12:18:05] <owencomiskey> And what if they wake you up at 3am with a text, telling you to come in for an earlier flight? This is going to become the new norm is it?  
[2018-04-26 12:32:34] <justincharbon> In my eyes a text is still not a confirmed acceptance, just info. So if you use “do not disturb” function on your phone you won’t be bothered 
[2018-04-26 12:34:12] <masterharkin> Is the active week going to become simply another planned week? Has anyone actual flown a full active week in the last 3 months without changes? We no longer have an active week. Going forward we will only have planned weeks. How do you co-ordinate a life with your family like that. Completely unacceptable! 
[2018-04-26 12:45:10] <arpadheger1977> On your days off or btw two (flight) duties (independently of minimum rest):
-You do NOT have to check your company iPad for duty changes, but you can if you want to
-You do NOT have to have your phone on or check it for messages or missed calls, but you can if you want to.

The next duty is confirmed with check-out, or Roster publication (edited)

[2018-04-26 13:42:58] <tuhhodge> On the other hand if most pilots weren't too lazy to check out, crew control wouldn't have extra work phoning people. 
	:+1: franchi88gabriele
[2018-04-26 13:49:17] <swfmcmanus> I still check out but shouldn't the EFL being verified with the on blocks be enough for an automated system to calculate the rest time etc? 
[2018-04-26 13:58:47] <brendanjacobs> I check out after every Duty. That doesn’t stop Crew Control from calling me whilst I’m asleep before an early Duty the next day. There aren’t enough of them in there to deal with everything. They don’t have enough crew on standby to cover any unforeseen circumstances and therefore have to wait for all ‘early’ Crew to land before they can start the process of ‘rolling’ duties so that all flights are covered the next day and everyone gets their minimum ‘rest’ (at least on paper). As long as the minimum notification period is not defined in the Ops manual, crew control are free to call us whenever they want and all under the protection of “a phone call doesn’t constitute an interruption to rest”. Until this is sorted out, best to turn phones off or onto do not disturb from 30mins after on blocks until 45 before off. 
[2018-04-26 14:00:48] <garethglennon> Anyone else realize how ridiculous RYANAIR sounds in this article?  
[2018-04-26 14:09:54] <fergus.cassidy> Honestly. It's everyone else's fault. We're playing nice. We're not trying to delay. The public or the majority of them anyway know what they are. 
[2018-04-26 14:14:44] <nilsholdrinet> Exactly what Brendan is saying. The problem with the IDP and the current system for that matter is that there are very little rules governing what Ryanair can or cannot do. We all know the ways of protection ourselves during rest/off days with not answering phones, do-not-disturb functions, etc, but the point is that this shouldn't be necessary. 

In any case, thanks for the input all! 
[2018-04-26 14:22:40] <brendanjacobs> Exactly, it shouldn’t be necessary. It won’t be in the future but until then we have to protect ourselves and not allow the company to contact us. 
[2018-04-26 14:23:15] <jfitzpatrick485> Would like to see a response (with teeth) to this very soon. The silence lately, has been deafening.

[2018-04-26 18:37:10] <andy.airamerica> @tuhhodge hi Tom, I’d like to mention 2 things in regards your comments. The first was when you said if you don’t confirm a notification crew control will just call you anyway. Well, I can recall two occasions on earlies I had a duty changed with no notification or phonecall. I saw it myself by changing the date on the EFL. Your second comment about checking out I will ask you have you gone to checkout and tried at least 3 or 4 computers without getting crewlink to log you in? This happens me 4 out of 5 days at least each time I try checkout. I just leave the crew room and don’t waste another minute of my time if the company can’t provide an adequate IT system.

[2018-04-30 09:39:54] @brendanjacobs commented on @adamtruran’s file FAGA14B0W: The duty does not start at off block time from the DH flight. Jump seat rules apply and therefore the Duty starts 25mins before. (Could be 20mins) whatever the jumpseat rule is, that’s the start of the Duty. CC may try apply 10mins ‘report’ time. This is not correct and should be amended.

[2018-05-06 14:33:35] <arpadheger1977> I also think the best is to get them in here and join this group to demonstrate unity 
[2018-05-06 14:35:13] <adamtruran> Just to confirm, do you need to be a member of a NPA to join? Because a lot of the guys are not in a union here (no union in Poland). 
[2018-05-06 14:37:30] <arpadheger1977> LOT has a union correct? If yes, would LOT be intereseted to support Ryanair pilots and let them join the union from LOT, change "the name" and convert to a national union. I know, not an easy one but who knows (edited)
[2018-05-06 14:41:49] <adamtruran> Hi Arpad. Some of the cabin crew have approached another union, pioneered by Lech Wałensa, and are gathering contracts from CC and pilots. Union of LOT is not interested in assisting apparently

[2018-05-07 11:34:07] <tomflood737> The general policy is to only allow members of an association onto Slack RPA. 
If it helps the overall cause, I don’t see why we should restrict those based in a Country without a current Union from gaining access here. @adamtruran Adam, could you put a list of names together of those wishing to gain access. 
 
[2018-05-07 15:59:00] <adamtruran> Hi all. We had a meeting here in WRO to discuss Ryanair Sun :sunny: and one thing surprised me. We started to speak about unions and our only LTC said his contract stipulated that he could not join a union. Would this be true or is it safe to say I can smell :hankey:?! He became LTC in January of this year.  
[2018-05-07 16:38:38] <adamtruran> Will do @tomflood737 . 
[2018-05-07 16:41:09] <arpadheger1977> I wouldn't know about a single country in europe that prohibits an individual to join a union. Even if an employer tries to prohibit it, it must be illegal (edited)
[2018-05-07 17:07:00] <kilroyrobin> You cannot be contracted outside of your rights.  
[2018-05-07 17:09:51] <oliver> I really doubt it, since it is illegal.
The only real “threat” is written in many base agreements saying thst the agreement will revert to a 5 on and 3 off if we are member of a union and cause “trouble”.

I’m sure this plan would only work if the downward spiral of our terms and condition went unchecked. So, it’s not a reality now.

[2018-05-19 16:41:17] <christianklaeren> We, as Anpac have no email from a pilot received, stating his issues with the video. Further I would like to highlight that we are working in our free time to improve the conditions of every single pilot. 
Picking up every single complaint on whole slack and evaluating it and needing to decide if it is just a venting of emotions or a real issue and then hitting the company with one complaint after the other, while we actually try to create a basis for negotiation which is based on a good atmosphere, is simply outside the capacity of the company council apart from not being feasible due to the negotiation process. 
Please use the channels which you have at your disposal in order to highlight this issue directly with the company instead of complaining that the company council have to do everything! We are doing our job here but will not be the commanded secretary of someone. This is outside my job description. 
Use query and the reporting system especially for safety issues. Use your LASG to highlight aswell. Further since this is a social media thing, you can also comment under the video distancing yourself from it and stating it does not represent your work ethic and that you highlight that it is a publicity stunt done in a simulator and does not reflect our work. 
With enough of this type of comments we might be able to show that it is not sensible to do such publicity. 
Thank you for making a first step yourself aswell!

[2018-05-19 17:43:06] <oliver> I did my first step by telling it in here, same as you did and as many orher pilots did aswell.
Its a stupid non flight safety related issue, that simply shows bad taste and how management perceives their pilot workforce. Furthermore there are no official channels to report this. If you think about it, it is a perfect issue for our ERC CC reppresentatives, some “ammunition” to show our management how offensive they are. ERC CC are our direct voice to management. If you have not enough people to do it maybe we can increase the number of CC, if otherwise it is a political strategic decision not to tell them in order not to stirr the water, than it is something esle and in that case you should urge us to officially not to complain in order to keep in line with your strategic process.  
[2018-05-19 18:06:39] <christianklaeren> @oliver I am asking myself why you call your Anpac company council as ERC CC? I think you have noticed the difference more than once by now...
There are query channels you can use or you can post on social media, which I have been made aware of that you used them to discredit the work Anpac is doing, meaning the work of the company council, stating we don’t work in your interest, which honestly speaking is quite demotivating, since we do this in our free time to reach a good result for all pilots which includes you. 
 
[2018-05-19 18:27:27] <oliver> Christian, am not trying to discredit anyone. I have questions and doubts as everyone else has, maybe I am outing them more vigorously than others, but believe me many have similar questions. 
Even you stated that these clips are demining and portray us as unprofessionals.
The fact that I called the company council, ERC CC, was simply not to say CC, as normally, when I say that I am talking about cabin crews. To tell the truth, lately we went trough so many acronyms that it would be nice to have a legenda for them.
 
[2018-05-19 18:46:33] <christianklaeren> We are open for constructive discussion and questions. We try to give meaningful answers respecting negotiations and associated limits in a possible answer. We have to divide our attention between important to our goal and others.

A lot of flights cancelled on Tuesday already!!

[2018-05-20 17:34:28] <osmo.kleemola> Is there a strike? 
[2018-05-20 17:35:08] <derekfdoyle> French ATC strike 
[2018-05-20 17:37:37] <brendanjacobs> Look at the DUB ones. CCF NTE is a standard duty pairing, no reason to cancel an entire rostered duty over an ATC strike. That’s gotta be lack of crew. Anyone else in other bases able to pick up paired flights? 
[2018-05-20 18:03:16] <andy.airamerica> Lack of crew. Anybody got a similar link to EasyJet and Jet2 to see what they cancel? 
[2018-05-20 18:11:23] <franciscofonseca93> Shouldn’t affect all those flights. At least that’s what I understand from the notam I read. attachments: [{"title":"DSNA-Direction des Op\u00e9rations","title_link":"HTTP:\/\/DSNADO.CANALBLOG.COM","text":"Site d'information relatif \u00e0 la situation du trafic a\u00e9rien \/ Information about Air Traffic situation.","fallback":"DSNA-Direction des Op\u00e9rations","from_url":"HTTP:\/\/DSNADO.CANALBLOG.COM","service_name":"DSNADO.CANALBLOG.COM","id":1,"original_url":"HTTP:\/\/DSNADO.CANALBLOG.COM"}] (edited)

[2018-05-20 18:31:32] <edward.scurr> In previous years Ryanair were very vocal about the strikes and demanding action from the governments to prevent cancellations. This year however, they are suspiciously quiet, anything to do with being able to blame their chronic lack of pilots and chaotic management structure on the ATC strikes?? 
	:100: andy.airamerica, franchi88gabriele
[2018-05-20 18:34:28] <fergus.cassidy> The Marseille strike is only a sector within France  yet numerous flights are cancelled. Smokescreen. They can be easily routed around or delayed. Isn't that why everyone is now MNPS qualified. 
[2018-05-20 21:25:13] <swfmcmanus> Exactly Fergus, I see a Faro Bristol on the list there... Absolutely no reason to allow a strike to affect that

[2018-05-21 06:26:39] <garethglennon> I counted to about 170 cancellations then got bored! That’s some amount  
[2018-05-21 06:36:03] <fergus.cassidy> Considering other airlines said they might cancel flights as they dont know how bad it could be yet. But Ryanair have cancelled in advance. Can they tell the future. Or is this just an excuse due crew shortages. I think we all know.

[2018-05-21 07:27:58] <swfmcmanus> I remember a few years ago sitting around waiting for 3 hours with a slot for ALC and then another hour back home when we got there, arrived in as the early shift were walking to work. It's interesting that they're not taking this approach now 
[2018-05-21 12:01:24] <boswellbrown> Any excuse to cut crew hours burn it would seem. 
[2018-05-21 12:23:47] <fergus.cassidy> Ibiza to Milan and Barcelona to Turin. Since when did they go through French airspace. Maybe lido is having a bad forecast jetstream tomorrow. Tgats just what I saw with a 30 second look at the list. Sure there are more. 
[2018-05-21 17:58:52] <andy.airamerica> Both of those probably talk with Marseille towards the end of the flight but still its obvious some are due to lack of crew.

[2018-05-22 17:23:21] <adamtruran> WRO update after Diarmuid Rodgers and Elaine Griffin meeting:

For those of you who missed the meeting, or who were late. Ryanair Sun issues have been presented to us with these solutions :
- WAW KTW POZ have enough volunteers to cover Sun, WRO soon will too (a few missing Captains only).
- no matter which contract, HOTAC and GT are provided in every case!
- if GT times are insufficient, you must call crew control on arrival at base, to confirm beginning of rest period.
- Out of base pay will only be provided to Sun flights requiring an overnight stay
- No extra pay for night flights
&gt;&gt; in max 4 weeks from now, Sun night flights and GT required duties shouldn't be on our rosters anymore as they're getting to required volunteer numbers. It's not to be excluded that we will perform "normal day" Sun flights, which is not our worry anyways.
- Low hours? Ryanair's aim is to fly all of us 800-850h per annum, they need us. Thus year is a bit particular due to launching of Sun schedules.
- block times are too short, it will be looked into. Normally planning is supposed to increase block times each year by 3%...

*Future plans*
- winter 18-19 : no Sun flights (position SP a/c to Canaries) 
- 2019 : 15 Sun a/c, 5/4 roster, current Storm rates, but probably with another contracting agency (Warsaw Aviation) with PL tax only.
- Sun a/c might be SP registration with PL AOC, in which case crew will for sure not be mixed, everything will be clearly separated. 
- Warsaw Aviation could be made available to normal ryanair pilots too (Ryanair is pushing Ireland to drop forced Irish income tax). Update in a few months.. Same rates, PL self-employed, possibly own accountant. 
- pay increase per hour is to be maintained "forever", WOFF payment will most probably be prolonged past October into long term. These will be included in Storm contracts upon renewal signatures.
- upcoming growth in France, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe, possible flights to Middle East.
- Sim center in eastern Europe, country to be determined.
- transparency system is being worked on for base transfers and annual leave. Ryanair would like to drop the month off system, could be available on individual basis.
- leave next year should be that it's applied for during the year, as it was previously 
[2018-05-22 17:35:29] <andy.airamerica> A few missing Captains? :joy: Inundated.

[2018-05-26 12:50:46] <gmulcair99> French ATC strike today I think  
[2018-05-26 12:53:51] <fergus.cassidy> Only Marseille sector. Could be easily routed around. If you had crews and hours. 
[2018-05-26 13:52:40] <coolhand787> Yes MRS ATC Strike! Are doing CRL FSC BVA FSC CRL. Now stuck in FSC Slot 16z We are on earlies, CI 0420z! So not necessarily routing around!  
[2018-05-26 15:06:52] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Well, let's say you're short on pilots. And cancelling flights again due lack of pilots could mean some serious head rolling.  Now a strike comes by. 
A pilot who doesn't fly today can fly next week, month or later. 
[2018-05-26 15:15:56] <fergus.cassidy> It's only a 7 day or 28 day patch, not a fix. Brain surgery at the top will fix this. Remove the tumour.

[2018-05-27 07:31:32] @brendanjacobs commented on @masterharkin’s file FAXQ4NLUE: I think it’s time to report these calls to FOPs base manager. They created a fancy app to allow us give our ‘availability’ on days off. If there’s none there, they shouldn’t call! I fully appreciate that this is not crew control’s fault, they’re just trying to cover flights, but this is ridiculous. No calls on days off unless it’s on the app! If there aren’t enough people volunteering days, that’s not our problem. If someone kept calling you at inappropriate times a judge would consider that harassment and would have a restraining order placed against that person or organisation. This is wholly inappropriate. Especially to the guys and girls with young children. I know, I have two. Sleep deprivation has been used for centuries as a form of torture. Babies and small children try to subject you to this constantly. You put measures in place during your working week to avoid this. But on your days off, you have to share the burden with your partner. Then when you’ve finally got a chance to get some sleep, these guys call and wake the whole house up!! Management need to take their heads out of their fucking arses and start negotiating! A start would be to recognise the RTPG, accept whatever pan European ‘general’ agreement is put in front of them (the work has been done for them, it’s our CPP), that covers ALL bases and countries to stop the exodus. They can then immediately get to work on working out and agreeing to issues at local level. There’s no other option in my mind. It’s only May and they are already fucked. Apologies for the profanities but we’re way past being polite. FIX IT or get the fuck out so someone else can save this airline!!

[2018-05-27 21:20:53] <daithi50> Lads and Lassies. I’ve finished my last day in Ryanair today with mixed emotion. I’m sorry to have to leave you all and have had the pleasure of working with and alongside some great mentors, colleagues and highly influential people in my time. I’ve also had the pleasure of representing you for a short period. I believe if you keep the pressure on that our management will have no other choice than to do what needs to be done for once and for all and engage with our council and IALPA in a meaningful and genuine way. This is THE only option. Once that happens Ryanair will be the place to work that it’s supposed to be. A place where each and every one of you are appreciated.  I became a member of the old ERC to try help management fix the problems that we are all facing because I care. Just like all of your council members and most of us on this group. I urge you to trust in the IRCC and IALPA into the future and know that they are working extremely hard to right the wrongs, all for the benefit of others and for the future stability of the company. I’m proud to have worked with you and wish that you all get what you deserve in the hopefully not so distant future. Take care everybody. Fly safe and fly proud knowing that you’re the hardest working bunch of individuals in the aviation industry (Did you know there’s 20% more roundabouts in Ireland than there was last year?) true statement. I bid you all a fond farewell. I will miss Ryanair’s people. They are what makes a company. :facepunch::muscle::o:

[2018-05-28 18:16:52] <sam.vanherzele> This morning: 2 calls before start of stby, but saved by the 'do not disturb'. 3rd call at start of stby to operate from another base. Report time 1hr07' after phone call and from a base more than 1hr drive from my home base. I requested a taxi. When the taxi didn't show up 10min past the agreed time, I gave crewcontrol a call back and was instructed to wait... When 2hr30 after agreed time, taxi still wasn't there they told me to just go home again and they would call someone else. (edited)

[2018-05-29 13:58:04] <brendanjacobs> If it’s considered duty, and Ryanair have accepted it as being duty, by assigning 50hrs a year, then we really shouldn’t be doing it on working days at all. Before work affects our max FDP, after work affects minimum rest period. An OFF day is a rostered OFF day free of all duty and is defined as such by EASA. I’m not sure where else we’re supposed to do it other than on standby. (edited)

[2018-05-29 14:39:59] <conorlyons4> No, Sorry Kevin  
[2018-05-29 16:12:11] <coolhand787> According EASA e learning needs to be rostered period! Now RYR claims these 50Hrs are only supposed to be used in STBY time as agreed with IAA, so not during off days or when on duty. But in any case rules are again being bent! According my info management supposes they when you are only flying 2 sectors then the remaining duty potentially 12hrs, should be used to complete e learning. What I would suggest is they each pilot, when completing any e learning course, to record the time spent. Post it to your CC and then when data collected one can check if 50Hrs are sufficient. Especially that RST are long winded affairs and PBN took me close to 2h30 if you want to do it thoroughly so not 6 modules x18min is utopia. So logging e learning time!  
[2018-05-29 16:44:07] <biondina> Maybe we should get WOFF for it if we do it on our off days. 50 / 12 = 4,2 days. So that’s extra money without screwing your colleagues over.

[2018-05-29 20:06:46] <kilroyrobin> A transnational Standards and Technical team of volunteers will soon be available through the RTPG for collecting points of concern Pilots May have such as this. They will be directly linked with expertise from across the European network through ECA, EASA as well as MA held experts internationally. They should revolutionise the way points of concern raised by pilots are addressed - now that’s not a huge statement since they are often simply ignored by our billionaire friendly profit sharing regulator so any improvement from ground zero is massive, but it is a great and brave new chapter in aviation safety that all volunteers involved should be proud to be a part of.

A big thank you to everyone who needed extra cash to pay for their car, children’s education, mortgage, utility bills etc etc etc and still said NO WOFF UNTIL WE FIX THIS. After that all the Professional Pilots in Ryanair will get behind this potentially excellent company and collectively bring it to where it belongs, sitting with the giants of the airline industry.

[2018-06-01 15:06:23] <boston58730> The Great Big WOFFing Elephant In The Room.

I am a current BALPA member and was a previous due paying RPG member. Since l switched to a FR contract from BRK I had previously been WOFFing 2/3 days per month to supplement my diminished earnings. I unilaterally stopped WOFFing from Sep last year at a considerable cost to myself and my family and started again this April after BALPA recognition. Why am I considered to be screwing my colleagues since I can never legally work more than my 900.

On the other hand an LTC would have trained at a conservative estimate 3 new Capt/FOs since September gifting the company a net increase of 2700 additional hours. I an not trying to point the finger at anyone else here but the last person I discussed this with was an LTC. When we do finally take industrial action anyone who knows me, knows I will be at the front of the picket line. If we start thinking about “what I can do for my union” instead of “what everyone else can do for me” this thing will be won by Christmas.

I will no longer WOFF because it is so damaging to union morale. Ryanair probably won’t even notice. If every LTC LCC and SFI on here was to stop training... I refuse to point the finger.

It goes without saying that I have never and will never WOFF during industrial action.

[2018-06-01 16:03:34] <tomflood737> A point to remember about WOFFing is that this option to supplement a declining income is not available to the Company Council members who are sacrificing all for the benefit of all. The company has clearly insisted this critical work should be done in our off days. This is not a sustainable option. 

The pilots need to decide how long they want this to continue and how long they are happy to plug the holes.

All things come to those who wait

We’ve waited decades in some cases 

We know what’s coming, turn up for these duties, no ride, call them once, and wait for them to call back

Any aggro 
“I’m not waiting 36 in the queue at however many :moneybag: a minute to be fucked around and phones put down, you’ll ring back eventually” 

Because I for one am not wasting my time chasing these clowns anymore and then being told to go to aircraft and rush all the paperwork on the Flightdeck with cabin crew, passengers and fucking dispatchers tutting at you

[2018-06-01 20:53:48] <pablomansoblanco> Tonight Flight VLC-IBZ-VLC cancelled 2hours before Ibiza departure, it seem that it is not possible to change the aircraft, with 4 a/c based in vlc and 1 in IBZ...

The flight was cancelled on RYR app and the handling agent in IBZ didn’t have any info at the airport. I was the first to inform the airport handling :man-facepalming::man-facepalming: about the cancellation and it took 45min to confirm the cancellation by Lesma waiting on the phone as number 2.

Ir is going to be a loooong summer!!:man-facepalming::man-facepalming:

[2018-06-01 21:00:05] <dohpau> I had a flight cancelled due to the Eurocontrol failure the other month. Again, the RYR app was the first thing to be updated, the passengers informed the Cabin Crew that the flight was cancelled, then I had to confirm this with Crew Control. Completely backwards. 
[2018-06-01 21:04:30] <fergus.cassidy> We are just secondary to their needs Paul. They see us as worthless, not an asset. They will only tell us if it impacts the next day and then if they think of it. PAX calling them out over the STN cancellations saying the wx was fine and they were sunbathing outside. 
[2018-06-01 21:23:11] <noelintogher> For that that very reason a UWOFF is the only Woff that should be worked by anyone until this is sorted out. Thanks for the hard work CC

[2018-06-02 01:41:24] <andy.airamerica> I have no knowledge of that needing to be agreed with the pilot Gregg. As long as it is legal under FTL they can roster minimum rest every week if they want. 
[2018-06-02 03:57:58] <ginosabatino> Already today 5 flights from dussledorf cancelled. (10 including the return sectors) 

Old Nikki won’t be happy!  
[2018-06-02 04:27:00] <fergus.cassidy> New FCI coming in the next few days. Due to adverse wx across Europe we are temporarily setting new limits. Few clouds below 10000, winds above 10 knots and and anything less than 10nm and for the safety of our passengers and crew we will not fly. Stay on the ground <http://please.as|please.as> an added safety measure we won't roster enough crew to your aircraft. This is just so you won't try and fly in this adverse wx and nothing to do with crew shortage. Honest. :crossed_fingers:

[2018-06-02 05:17:33] <biondina> Apparently they all missed their slots due to the fact the handling does not understand our working methods and are unable to do the normal turnarounds. AGB.

[2018-06-02 07:16:38] <constantin> The flights have been canceled before we even got to the airport. Four out of five AC diverted to cologne yesterday night and apparently no crews available to fly the planes over to Düsseldorf. My second day in Düsseldorf and all my flights have been canceled so far :+1::skin-tone-3::smile: (edited)
[2018-06-02 09:05:41] <osmo.kleemola> So they opened the base yesterday with 5 a/c. All diverted on the first day due to night curfew and due to that they cancelled the whole first wave. Well done.

[2018-06-02 09:29:52] <ginosabatino> Shocking. Total lack of a plan B. Imagine if everytime we went to work we had no plan B,C and D. The real rubbish part, is this is what is effecting their precious productivity! Even worse leaving crews without pay as their flights cancelled. 

Time to activate plan roundabout!

[2018-06-02 11:30:17] <osmo.kleemola> In Frankfurt there is very strict night curfew as well. I don't have proper statistics, but after we diverted to Hahn last night, the dispatcher told me that there is one diversion nearly every day and more when the weather is bad.

For example BCN flight from Frankfurt. They started to fly with CI100 to maintain the schedule, then they decreased the block times to match the CI100 flight times and now it is late pretty much every day. The block time is 2hours, flight time is 1:40-1:45 with CI100 and with the taxi times in Frankfurt and Barcelona, I'd say impossible...

[2018-06-02 14:02:51] <masterharkin> Here’s one for you: I picked up my new iPad and I was asked to tick 1 of 2 boxes. Either to give the old one back or purchase the old one. I said oh I might purchase the old one to which I was told to “sign this direct salary deduction form”. But how much are you taking from my salary. We haven’t decided yet. Seriously an open ended salary deduction. Is everything a scam? 
[2018-06-02 14:05:41] <garethglennon> It would be interesting to know how other airlines work with this sort of stuff.  
[2018-06-02 14:14:17] <mauricetreanor> I ticked the box to purchase but wrote "subject to price" beside it. 
[2018-06-02 14:14:52] <masterharkin> Nice :bulb:  
[2018-06-02 14:18:57] <iglehane> I told them to keep it. Balls to them. 
[2018-06-02 14:19:57] @speke777 commented on @garethglennon’s file FB0LT5B1B: Has anybody raised this with IAA and/or CHIRP?
[2018-06-02 14:48:39] <swfmcmanus> I wouldn't trust the price they offer... Still haven't given back the old one because I haven't seen the BC in when I've had the old one in the bag... 
[2018-06-02 15:36:10] <howard.denis> They told me it’s €150 for the old one they can keep it!! Wouldn’t trust anything from them!! 
[2018-06-02 15:54:22] <andy.airamerica> If they are offering to sell it to you then we can be sure there is some profit built in for them otherwise why would they do it. Their other option is to return 4000+ iPads to Apple and you would bet the price Apple is offering is not €150.   
[2018-06-02 17:41:44] <greggmcavan> That says it all
CI100 to meet the schedule then cut the times to save a few euro

Total and utter lack of ability to run this shitshow  
[2018-06-02 17:50:20] <fergus.cassidy> Not only that. More time pressure on us to complete flights with inadequate block times. I knew a captain once all 320 knots to 3500 feet then slow down so he could get more flights by always saving time. His 900 hour limit but was actually been paid about 950 hours due always saving time. I told him they were only going to cut the block times but all he wanted was the extra money. More time pressure on everyone else. It's the same with them we can schedule xxx hours out of each pilot everyday but in reality they will always be late but its works from a scheduling point. In reality if they used proper block times it would need planned discretion.

[2018-06-02 23:06:28] <garethglennon> There’s an inner thing in every man,
Do you know this thing my friend?
It has withstood the blows of a million years,
And will do so to the end.
It was born when time did not exist,
And it grew up out of life,
It cut down evil’s strangling vines,
Like a slashing searing knife.
It lit fires when fires were not,
And burnt the mind of man,
Tempering leadened hearts to steel,
From the time that time began.
It wept by the waters of Babylon,
And when all men were a loss,
It screeched in writhing agony,
And it hung bleeding from the Cross.
It died in Rome by lion and sword,
And in defiant cruel array,
When the deathly word was ‘Spartacus’
Along the Appian Way.
It marched with Wat the Tyler’s poor,
And frightened lord and king,
And it was emblazoned in their deathly stare,
As e’er a living thing.
It smiled in holy innocence,
Before conquistadors of old,
So meek and tame and unaware,
Of the deathly power of gold.
It burst forth through pitiful Paris streets,
And stormed the old Bastille,
And marched upon the serpent’s head,
And crushed it ‘neath its heel.
It died in blood on Buffalo Plains,
And starved by moons of rain,
Its heart was buried in Wounded Knee,
But it will come to rise again.
It screamed aloud by Kerry lakes,
As it was knelt upon the ground,
And it died in great defiance,
As they coldly shot it down.
It is found in every light of hope,
It knows no bounds nor space
It has risen in red and black and white,
It is there in every race.
It lies in the hearts of heroes dead,
It screams in tyrants’ eyes,
It has reached the peak of mountains high,
It comes searing ‘cross the skies.
It lights the dark of this prison cell,
It thunders forth its might,
It is ‘the undauntable thought’, my friend,
That thought that says ‘I’m right!’

[2018-06-04 15:46:06] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FB25671UN with text: @kilroyrobin uploaded a file: FB25671UN and commented: The Air Line Pilots Association, International is the largest pilot union in the world, representing more than 60,000 pilots from 34 U.S. and Canadian airlines. They have been in action since 1931, big and powerful, but not too big or too powerful to miss our brave efforts across the pond. 

They have been great supporters and came over to run a very well attended negotiating course here in Dublin. Company Council members from every country attended, we listened and learned to what they had to say. 

In terms of communications they went through the various strategies they engage in, some incredibly elaborate, incredibly hight tech, incredibly connected, informed, qualified, experienced, everything that we would aspire to. 

Of all these techniques there was one which was their clear favourite. One that is incredibly simple and fundamentally important because it communicates to its Pilots who are the driving force of any Pilots association. They call it “Pilot 2 Pilot” - and now so do we. 

In this model you keep 10 to 20% of your pilots in a very well informed core, you make them identifiable so that people know who to ask, or who to talk to. Look out for the P2P dog tags. They will be in Ireland, but you will soon see them elsewhere too. 

These Pilots have been kept informed and know what is going on, they volunteer to stand out and step up so that other members can keep much better informed than has been possible so far. Strategy is still strategy, not everything can be public to members and this is of course for the good of the members, but as close as you can get these guys will get you there by word of mouth.

What’s taking so long? 
Why don’t we do XYZ?
Why have we not tried XYZ? 
What about this idea?
I missed the meetings, what came up? 
Where can I get a yellow lanyard?

When they don’t have an answer for you? they will find one out for you. Pilot 2 Pilot must be seen as a two way channel, we in the Councils will be better informed as well if Pilots take this advice to heart. In a members association your Council is steered by its members so please all help to bring P2P to life.

To the P2P pilots, thank you for standing out and stepping up. I know what it takes, be proud you have it.
[2018-06-04 19:37:19] @andy.airamerica commented on @kilroyrobin’s file FB25671UN: Looking forward to seeing these spread throughout Europe. Well done to all who volunteered.
[2018-06-04 20:01:26] <fergus.cassidy> And for those not involved please spread the word about the initiative. Tell the pilot you fly with, the colleague you share a jumpseat with on your next OOB or the friend you know in a different base. The more you know about this P2P the more will benefit and the quicker it will have an effect. Everything is done by the pilots for the pilots. On your own you are a whisper but together we can roar.

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air....

Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace.
Where never lark, or even eagle flew —
And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
– Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

[2018-06-08 11:53:37] <masterharkin> Here’s how my day went yesterday: I rock up in the crewroom to discover I had no FO, no #1,2 or 3. Ring ops and I’m told to take the standby cabincrew and they will try find me an FO. Then I’m told don’t take the standby Cabincrew because they haven’t got enough hours. Then I’m told take them for boarding and we will try get both an FO and Cabincrew from an inbound flight. Hold on I say I’m going to MJV and it has a night curfew of 20:30z so I won’t be allowed to land to which I’m told oh “if your not going to make the curfew don’t land.” Seriously!!Yesterday I was Crewcontrol, I was Operations and I was a Captain. Lucky I’m earning €1,000,000 otherwise I might feel hard done by.

[2018-06-08 13:12:02] <polboix> And here is how my day went: I get to the crewroom nice and early for a "handy" Brussels Murcia. The efl looks odd with two captains and 5 CC's so gave a call to ops to see what the story was. 
Surprisingly enough ops had no idea what was happening so after holding for 10 mins I get to the conclusion that I'll have one captain for the Brussels and Stephen will meet me when back in Dublin for the Murcia. Of course slots were the norm of the day so we were running 45 mins late on departure for he first sector with another subsequent slot in Brussels. As soon as we get back to Dublin I check the efl thinking 'there's no way we'll still do the Murcia the airport will be closed when we get there' but as there is no apparent pilot shortage off we went hurrying up to close the aircraft up and rush to meet Stephen waiting patiently in a fully loaded aircraft waiting for us. No way we're gonna make that night curfew I thought, but after some creative thinking and direct begging to every atc station we got there and back just on time to chock on exactly 13 hours after I left home that morning. There is no fatigue and no pilot shortage... Tick tock :clock10:

Because until then RYR Management are a bunch of amateurs who think they know better. Word of these massive cancellations (10% of daily flights) has to get to our shareholders and to the public to warn them of the management shortcomings. The reason it is still not in the papiers is that RYR are hiding behind ATC strikes and WX line TS! And if papers publish anything else RYR night try to come after them and sue the paper for whatever reason some lawyer thinks right! The only place I can see Thunderstorms is in DUB HQ.

[2018-06-11 09:38:56] <nilsholdrinet> Was talking with one of the dispatchers today, while waiting for a weight change (that took about 45 minutes). Apparently in DUB 20 groundstaff per day are being asked by HQ to work overtime/double shifts, even though according to the dispatcher it's not legal according to the Ryanair regulations. 

Same story with crew, Dublin this morning was a mess, flights missing cabin crew, some with 5 cabin crew unnecessarily, late changes of flight crew, crew control unreachable by anyone.

It's falling apart left and right, this kind of operation is not sustainable (as we already know). Safety is becoming seriously endangered with everyone from top to bottom working the maximum or even over the maximum. 

This fight is not just for our sakes, it's for everyone in the airline (and the airline industry beyond) (edited)

Thank you all for your unwavering support and especially for always taking the time to be well informed in the decisions you make. 

As you can imagine the buoyant and proactive atmosphere in the room today pours octane in the fuel of those who seek to represent you. 

Also, while faced with that room full of yellow lanyards, I noticed that the planes outside the window that we are so proud to fly Carry the very same simple yellow lanyard around their chin. The same symbol of Unity and Respect as their Pilots. 

When I see the current chaos around us I cannot help but think that in this one case in history things have gone so mad that it’s actually the Unions that are the closest to ‘company men’ here, the Unions after all have the only solutions to the obsessive compulsive accounting disorder by which this company has been so blindly lead for so long, and through which our Pilots must now find a way. 

So why do you wear a yellow lanyard? “Because I’m proud to fly that plane, and because I’m proud to fix this place”

Why can they not accept that, in general, the day you need discretion you have probably had a shitty day and is possibly the time you shouldn't use discretion, especially as you may only be landing in the early hours of the morning.

[2018-06-12 20:05:40] @kilroyrobin commented on @kilroyrobin’s file FB683UB7V: I am very proud to see that what we do in Ryanair could go some way towards strengthening a more ‘social Europe’, this naturally has a direct connection to our employment models In Ryanair. We probably have here one of the best examples in Europe of how far the failure of proper pan European social standards in the employment sector can be pushed by a ruthless employer. 

I am motivated by this wider agenda just as much as by our own ever decreasing conditions within Ryanair. I often receive positive responses to this kind of narrative in our Pilot meetings. I hope that employees outside Ryanair, and all of us within Ryanair realise that there is a strong potential synergy here for the good of all European employees.

We are after all the definitive model that everyone else fears - unfortunately, (or ‘fortunately’ - you might say in fact - if what you actually need is people best placed to drive change, who want change, HERE WE ARE:raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: ).

[2018-06-14 12:28:37] <endaryan> Guys can I make a suggestion re Crew Control that we all bear in mind - there will always be someone in every department who will adopt the Ryanair culture of treating people with disdain and disrespect. We’re used to it and by all means if this happened to me.... open duck season. 

However with the exception of new people we were promised, if there are any, these people are colleagues we have known for years. The are under serious pressure and have been given a job to do. We all know the result culture that exists. 

Can I ask that we retain the respect between Crew Control and the pilots when dealing with them unless the situation openly warrants different. :+1::skin-tone-3:

[2018-06-22 14:48:26] <fourdonks> That's what I was afraid of. Push for rostered days for CBT study, and all that happens is we randomly lose another day off. Fine if it's just two 6/3s per year, but from what you say, it's more...

[2018-06-23 12:47:11] <fergus.cassidy> The truth is reality has finally set in. People know it will never improve for us unless we change it ourselves. The reality is everything is seen as a cost. Block hours are too short, any delays no matter what they cost are unpaid. There's even a picture on FRTV today of a crew enjoying breakfast in BVA during tech delay. No mention of the fact the crew are paying for their own food. How they see this as a good thing. Propaganda must be a necessary part of their institutionalised rationale. Rewarded for selling an action can rather than customer service. 3 days off line with no sector pay for cabin crew and on off days sometimes. If they are ringing everyone on off days during a planned strike when they knew it in advance is a sad indication of what is ahead for the summer. Now, more than ever your continued support and talking to your colleagues is how we finally fix what will be an amazing company.

How sweet are those little chirping birds. Sometimes one pops up, 
how handsome this bird looks. 
Seems like he is lonely, 
only a few around. 
Just a few got woken up during their rest before a duty or even worse on an off day by a call from crewcontrol. 
Looks like only a handful was unlucky...

Imagine there would be a swarm of chirping birds! If they would get their rest disrupted...oh boy...what noise they would make...Hitchcock’s classic would only be a foreplay....

[2018-06-24 14:43:09] <nicolau_swart> Guys I’ve got a question, I have 4:30 min remaining to complete 100 hours in 28 days until tomorrow 13:00z. If tomorrow’s duty is scheduled to be 5:40min block on earlies starting at 0530z and finishing at 11:35z can I refuse to fly knowing that tomorrow I’ll be over the 100 hours in 28 days? 
[2018-06-24 15:03:05] <christianklaeren> It happened to me that I flew sector 3 and 4 because the other CPT got off because he was high/out of hours. 
[2018-06-24 15:39:19] <kilroyrobin> Because it’s rolling 28 days it may not bust 100hrs by tomorrow, have you checks? 
[2018-06-24 15:52:47] <fergus.cassidy> Their system is netline. When you check in tomorrow select duty plan, tomorrow's date and step back till Monday Tuesday the 29th. That's 28 days in their calender. If it's over 100 inform them by whatever means you can. Probably email or ops manager and tell them to pass on the message. They tried to put me over 100 a few times in the past. Use their own system. They can't argue.
Let us know how it works out. You've got to mind yourself as they can just hit the ignore warning button. I've seen it before. 
[2018-06-24 16:15:56] <boswellbrown> Tom.. best to keep it turned off to avoid disturbed rest.:grin: 
[2018-06-24 16:27:19] <dohpau> Make sure their hours are correct with your logbook though, there's been plenty of rumours over the years of disappearing flights and ammended block times when pilots are approaching limits... 
[2018-06-24 19:05:20] <jgrooney> If very near 100 hrs , I ask them to run the flights they want you to do and see what’s left . They wanted to take me off a LGW and get me to do a NCE . I told them the call is recorded and asked them what the hrs were then, putting me at 99:23 in 28 days . I said any delays of over 37 mins after off blocks putting me over 100hrs and I’ll be illegal to do the return . Does the aircraft insurance allowing this also if affected crew over 100 hrs have an incident ? They wouldn’t risk it and I was left on the LGW . :face_with_rolling_eyes:

[2018-06-27 20:44:55] <boston58730> So sad that in this day and age, he has to resort to such action. Anyone outside of Ryanair will think this is a publicity stunt. I personally am surprised there’s not an army of angry crew out there.

[2018-06-29 07:02:34] <brendanjacobs> Today is a great day. I’ve been looking forward to it all week. Not because today is the day of the count and the beginning of the next phase in our efforts to better conditions for all staff in Ryanair. I’ve been looking forward to that for sure. But selfishly, the main reason I’ve been looking forward to today, is because it’s my day 5. Which means tomorrow is my day 1 off. I plan to spend my days off with my wife and two kids. Given it’s a weekend, and the weather we’re having, makes it even better. I share the same roster pattern with one of my Company Council members. Today is also his day 5. Tomorrow however, is NOT his day off. Tomorrow is his day 1 of his other full time job. He won’t be having a bbq with his friends or going to the zoo with his kids. He’ll be on the phone, writing emails, making preparations for what’s to come. He’ll continue to work tirelessly to improve mine, and YOUR work and personal lives in Ryanair for now AND into mine and your retirement. When the inevitable phone call comes over the next 4 days, asking if I’d be willing to help the company and work a day off. I’ll be saying, “sorry, I can’t I’m afraid, I’m spending it with my family”. When my Council member gets the call, he’ll say, “sorry, I’m afraid I’m already working, I’m already helping the company out to ensure the future success of the airline”. I like money, I’m sure my council member likes money too. It could go toward that family holiday we’ve been looking forward to. But there are more important things right now. Like securing permanent pay increases not temporary bribes, which only serve to delay the inevitable. There is a shortage of crew, the sooner the company accept this, the sooner we can all get on with fixing the problems and secure permanent increases to our salaries without the need to supplement them by working on our hard earned days off. So, when crew control call, what will be your excuse? If you don’t have one, think about your council member who would love to be spending this sunny day with his or her family but can’t, because he’s working, working for you. Use him or her as your excuse. And if you really must work, pick up the phone, give them a call and say, “how can help?”. But that’s just my view..... (edited)

So if you've got one of those unrealistic rosters, share it, let others see the hell you have in front and you and let them give advise as to how you can best manage your next 4 weeks.
That is part if what slack is. A chance to get help from your colleague's and share information.

[2018-07-01 20:14:31] <jgrooney> Crew are on duty until arrived at the hotel . I’d tell the agent about duty hours limits , for them to sort it out and then sit back and count the duty hours . Eventually, a light bulb moment will occur in this company , that a company this size should have a 24hr contactable  travel desk in Ops to look after all this stuff . Sticking to a low low B737-200 cost model will cost them millions on lost flights and onboard sales / revenue , for the sake of two or more salaries attached to CC for travel etc. Over 2000 cancelled flights since April end ...that could have been rerouted , with onboard sales of 200 Euros plus  profit per sector , (400,000 Euros min) would pay two salaries for such extra CC/Travel staff with profit left over and less crew duty hours ,which are worth a weight in gold now . A company on such a continued staff cost cutting trail to add to annual profits and affect the share price in a positive trend , will use Crews goodwill to fix a problem/ find solutions etc if the problems get sorted so long as the crew will do it . It’s only business . But it a loss making stance long term with expansion unsupported and crew getting tired of uncertainty!!!!

[2018-07-02 08:00:13] <damiano.detomassi> Perfect analysis  
[2018-07-02 09:25:55] <brendanjacobs> Has anyone used MCC pilot as an electronic log book? Any good? Can you have all previous flights uploaded in excel or some other format? With that in mind, has anyone had any success getting a complete log of their hours with Ryanair, not just the last 2 years available on Netline? Who do we contact to get it? 
[2018-07-02 09:57:24] <martin.loxbo> I use it, works fine! I only had paper logbook before so I did everything the old fashioned way but there are also several ways to import previous flights. You should be able to try the full program for free, you just need to pay to get cloud/phone sync and automatic day/night time calculation. 
[2018-07-02 09:57:43] <rvelthove> Yes, great logbook software, I use it since years and always great. Questions answered in short time, and no, I don't have any shares or connection with it.
Just forward your efb email with submitted data on it to them and it's in your logbook.
Also you can get backdated flights in via excel/pdf as well I think, the data im not sure, try your bc 
[2018-07-02 10:00:19] <fergus.cassidy> I've been using it since the start. Tech support us brilliant. They Skype call you and work through any issues. Try the free version. It doesn't import your roster till you pay the charge but its a once off payment. No annual subscription. I have no issues with it.  I recommend it to everyone. 
[2018-07-02 10:07:23] <boston58730> I use and can recommend MCC Pilot Log. FR opened a dedicated query channel for guys asking for a record of all flights back in (I think) 2012. They closed it shortly afterwards to new applicants because they couldn’t handle the number of requests. I left the query open just to see how long it would take. It was still open until they moved to the zen desk system when it suddenly disappeared. 
[2018-07-02 10:24:39] <johnmurray737> Brendan I know Ronan Walsh got it off some one in the last few months. Maybe contact him.  
[2018-07-02 10:24:45] <brendanjacobs> Thanks lads, would prefer not to have an annual subscription like log10 pro, this seems to be the answer. Just need to get my hours from FR as I lost all my data when my laptop died! Anyone tried Lewis? 
[2018-07-02 10:29:40] <jbubbel> You can use the EFL as well to access your flights. You just need to set your IPADs date back to the month you would like to see.  
[2018-07-02 10:45:42] <conorlyons4> Brendan try the BC, heard before BC’s can give you all your RYR hours in excel format which can the be imported into the MCC, 
[2018-07-02 10:54:40] <philip.ardagh> I've been getting the run-around for months looking for those hours, no one seems to want to give them and I haven't burnt any bridges over the years. @ronan.walsh22 can you chime in on this?  
[2018-07-02 11:04:39] <ronan.walsh22> I was just looking for the contact but I think it’s on my work email and I’m away at the moment. It took me 6months, multiple queries and numerous emails. Eventually I got photocopy of the years I requested. Try Ray Conway’s secretary, I think it was her who put me in contact with the final guy who got them for me. 
[2018-07-02 11:29:12] <fergus.cassidy> Your base manager can get them for you. You can get the last 2 years on crewlink. I asked for mine a few months ago and got them in a few days. Your B.C. has access to the years previous to 2 years if he is willing to get it for you. 
[2018-07-02 11:30:46] <brendanjacobs> I assume the reluctance to provide people with their hours is because they’re afraid everyone is leaving! 
[2018-07-02 12:20:34] <philip.ardagh> BC sent me off somewhere else as did Ray's pa, as did the base manager. It is because they are afraid of people leaving, I was told in so many words by one of them. If you find it will you send it on Ro please, cheers.

[2018-07-02 16:04:50] <garethglennon> Sorry to hear! Rest In Peace! Any idea what happened?  
[2018-07-02 16:58:46] <ginosabatino> I did it in CAG with a strike day and it worked 
[2018-07-02 22:56:20] <dieter.vanheymbeeck> I uploaded 2 years on MCC pilotlog by taking a USB stick to the crewroom and saved the 2 years from crewlink on it. Afterwards you can import that file and it automatically logs all those flights for you! (except crewmember and registration obviously) 
[2018-07-02 23:04:53] <jbubbel> Crewmember and registration are stored in the EFL system since the start of the EFL.  How long time ago was that again...?

[2018-07-03 14:06:51] <adamtruran> Hi all. Can we make a group dedicated to Ryanair Sun?
I also have a question as to whether, we as contract pilots, our contracts allow us to fly wet lease for this :hankey: operation. Would appreciate any thoughts.

[2018-07-03 14:08:46] <oliver> Its a lil anti intutive, but once explained it becomes second nature. The silly limitation is that you cant attach a pic or document to a reply message.

	:+1: dohpau, coolhand787
[2018-07-03 14:12:31] <oliver> I believe we should insert in the CLA a section pertaining to extra pay when flying wet lease for other companies..... RYR makes money out of that, we should to, since most of the time it would possibly include odd ours, OOB, extra out of pocket expenses, etc.
Am thinking something like OFFDAY extra pay. (edited)

[2018-07-03 14:45:32] <scotthemeryck> I queried Declan Ryan on this matter. Please state where it is written in my contract where I can fly for Laudamotion/RYS. He said it’s a RYR wetlease. Same query to STM but could not point out where, just that ‘the client’ is who we fly for. 
[2018-07-03 14:52:29] <chrisy5> Does it not say you are not allowed to fly for anyone else in the contract ?  
[2018-07-03 14:52:48] <rvelthove> Maybe lauda motion as well 
[2018-07-03 14:59:28] <swfmcmanus> Always learning Oliver... Thanks for that... Might be worth to mention to the developers (edited)
[2018-07-03 16:22:13] <adamtruran> I spoke with ECA and he said there could be something about this not being legal.  
[2018-07-03 18:21:24] <coolhand787> Thanks for digging into this Adam yes, I checked my RYR contract. The way I read it we are not allowed to fly for another airline. Only RYR operation. And J am pretty sure same goes for contractors.  
[2018-07-03 20:04:02] <greggmcavan> That was Defo in the old BRK deals because in theory crews should have got permission to bounce round of a weekend in a bug basher

[2018-07-04 09:24:46] <boswellbrown> Given that it’s Vodafone, they should be able to organise country access numbers very quickly. This would save us the cost of calling Irish numbers. The service costs very little, very simple solution. For those not familiar, you have a local landline number for each country. Dial it at your local rate or using inclusive minutes and all calls are ported back to Dublin. 
	:ok_hand: max_palm, pcerutti, fourdonks, cianmurray, padawa
[2018-07-04 09:39:36] <robwatts99> Is typical ryanair though. Option A. Would cost them a little to set it up and save us money to call or option B, cost us a bit to call and save them cost to set it up. We all know which option is more palatable to them.  
[2018-07-04 09:43:32] <damiano.detomassi> Same as local vs Irish bank  
[2018-07-04 12:31:12] <boswellbrown> It’s a small change and not unreasonable, how about we add it to their “to do list”? (edited)
[2018-07-04 12:42:07] <boston58730> I just assumed it was a premium rate number and that they were making money from it.  
[2018-07-04 13:14:22] <christianklaeren> You can call them with Skype etc from your phone. Helps reducing the cost. 

Regarding why they did not implement? I could speculate that no one told them about the possibility and they did not think it is needed. Maybe they did not want a local because they feared that this would make them somehow national in that country...just speculating :thinking_face:

[2018-07-05 19:48:30] <coolhand787> Yes Nils I noted this could be a GDPR violation indeed. I would appreciate the info of the specialists on this matter. Would not surprise me if RYR ‘forgot’ about this law ...  
[2018-07-05 19:56:35] <tomflood737> Probably posted in error - we’ve asked for a list of Dublin pilots but never received a reply.  
[2018-07-05 20:00:33] <biondina> No they did not. We moodled our way through that. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
[2018-07-05 20:39:44] <kilroyrobin> When a day one Cadet apologises to me because of his mistakes, I don’t accept his apology because I was the same once, what is more I can remember it clearly. I may try to show them the way I got to where I am now, but I will never ridicule them.

When you get through the fear barrier in any battle with management it is not then time to turn around to those still stuck behind the barrier and ridicule them, I don’t ridicule those whose decisions are based upon fear because I was the same once, what is more I can remember it clearly. I may try to show them the way I got to where I am now, but I will never ridicule them. 

All it took for fear to get a hold on me was enough debt, not enough hours, and being denied a base at home - while others were denied anything other than my home base. Clever really isn’t it. Clever, but not sustainable. 

We are a part of one of the most perfectly divided work forces in history, divided by contract, divided by country, divided by rights, divided by those who got and by those who did not - through which logic we know not, divided by design but not by our design. Our design is unity.
  
It is natural as we move towards the inevitable in Ireland and abroad that tensions will run high between those that fall either side of the fence, but I am asking that all bear the following in mind. 

The fence is not our fence, the fence is our foe, the Pilot who may still be caged by it is not our foe. We have better things to do back up on the high ground where we have always kept our fight rather than wrestling down in the mud.  

From start to finish in this I ask that we never drag our fight down into the dirt, we are professionals and all of us must be able to fly together come hell or high water. Besides all that - anything less is about as smart as clearing seagulls off the top of your high flying hydrogen Zeppelin with a flame thrower because their shit may stain the paint. A home goal. We will leave that to someone else.

[2018-07-05 20:52:08] <sam.vanherzele> Received an email with my hotel booking in BGY this week, had to look for my own name  in a list of names, dates, hotels and booking numbers of everyone else being sent to BGY this week. Think someone in stansted ops forgot to do the GDPR course...
Any legal advice on this?
Also, anyone of those 17 people on the list could have easily cancelled all other bookings as all data was there.

[2018-07-05 21:17:49] <fergus.cassidy> The constant hope of getting a promotion, getting a home base, getting enough hours so should be a daily, monthly, yearly battle we should be fighting. We are hear to fly aircraft safely, not fly them because we're afraid of what management will do if we dontvturn up for work. As Robin said rise above it all for the future of this airline we hold in our grasps. RYR version 2.0 will be our goal and we will look forward to every day from that day on. At the moment our version 1.0 is looking like a -0.5 version as every year we seem to take a step backwards in our terms and conditions. Stand strong and proud for the next while and we all will have a bright new future. :reminder_ribbon::muscle: 
[2018-07-05 22:36:37] <nilsholdrinet> Did a quick check. Not all pilots are on that list ( my fo for today couldn't find himself), but it does have roughly 3600 pilots on that list. (edited)
[2018-07-05 23:02:05] <biondina> Same in CGN. Got the booking details for 20 people for the next 2 weeks. GDPR does not apply for STN ops it seams.

[2018-07-06 11:55:13] <andyappeltans> Since we ade talking about GDPR anyway. How would giving out a private number to a taxi company fall under this? We were with 2 crews waiting for a taxi to pick up our aircraft after diversions the night before and the other fo got a call from the taxi driver. That doesn't look like protected private data to me. 
[2018-07-06 12:10:41] <andy.airamerica> Did they put you in the InterCity Hotel Daniel? 
[2018-07-06 12:14:11] <andy.airamerica> Personally I wouldn't see a problem with this. Its common practice for a pre-arranged taxi driver to have your phone number in order to better coordinate a pickup time and location. I'd rather be in direct contact with the driver than have to go through the middle man/crew control every time.

I can only imagine the chaos it will cause with holding and diversions whilst stn shuts....you may want more than the 200kg continency fuel...! I think its either tue/wed/thur he arrives, details all a bit sketchy in press.

[2018-07-07 08:13:07] <oliver> Would be nice to have those yellow lanyards also in Italy.
Havent seen any yet. 
[2018-07-07 08:13:59] <aliolimarco.job> I've one. Got it from Ciampino base! They have few of them 
[2018-07-07 08:27:05] <oliver> Marco you are lucky 
[2018-07-07 08:28:35] <aliolimarco.job> Perhaps someone here can send it to you  
	:+1: oliver
[2018-07-07 08:39:01] <jwarren> There are a few in bgy above the ph’s 
[2018-07-07 08:40:21] <oliver> Nice, nothing in MXP,
maybe I can get a few in BGY on the 19 
[2018-07-07 10:09:29] <damiano.detomassi> U saw the one I gave to my old base last time around (December ) 
[2018-07-07 10:23:00] <oliver> Just wondering why Anpac didnt simply distribute them to all italian bases 
[2018-07-07 12:56:20] <sam.vanherzele> Hi @oliver. They were distributed to all MXP pigeon holes back in November. Unfortunately not everyone is wearing them. I have quite some spares in my flight bag so next time you see me, just remind me. I can leave one in your ph when I'm back from annual leave. (edited)
[2018-07-07 13:01:03] <oliver> Sure, I arrived in april and never seen anyone wearing them.
If you have a spare I will take it.
Thanks 
[2018-07-07 13:16:56] <fergus.cassidy> Even get a few spares Oliver and hand them out yourself along with your educational skills. :reminder_ribbon::muscle:

[2018-07-08 15:22:15] <damiano.detomassi> I yellowed around 5 bases so far thanks to the help of British and Irish colleagues that sent me the lanyards . Never could use PH as that is considered misconduct by the company but took the occasion to speak to each and everyone of the pilots , cabin and at times dispatchers I yellowed. It’s as important as to show the next guy how many we are by wearing yellow . (edited)

[2018-07-09 16:18:59] <nilsholdrinet> From WhatsApp, utterly disgusting behaviour by our company. 

Good morning,
As you are probably informed already we are the PMI crew that overnight in CGN and got a meeting to DUB because we refused to fly on captain discretion. We want you to be aware of our situation and everything that happened between the 08/07/18 and 09/07/18.

“On the 08/07/18 we were operating a MAD-CGN flight starting from PMI base (12:15z departure). Due tu lack of personal in PMI and slots in MAD we knew already before leaving PMI for the last two sectors that we would have been on captain discretion. Despite all that we left anyway. 

We landed in CGN 20:48z plus we had to wait an extra 20min to be able to disembark the PRM. 
As procedure the captain asked the all crew if they were willing to fly back on discretion. The First Officer agreed on doing that but us, as cabin crew we all agreed that we were not fit to fly anymore. 
The captain understood our decision and called the duty pilot to explain him our situation and the duty pilot understood our decision as well and told us that was our legal right to do that. He than informed that captain that someone from DUB would contact him.
The captain then received a call from a manager in DUB asking him to force his crew to operate the flight back. The captain refused to do that and let the manager speak to the cabin crew individually. 

The first cabin crew who spoke with her was the N2.
The manager told him if he was refusing to fly he then answer that he was not refusing to fly but he was unfit to fly and that if something happened safety wise he wouldn’t be able anymore physically or mentally to deal with the situation. She then repeat that he was refusing to fly so he repeat the same answer. She than asked which day was for him and how was possible that he was fatigue on his 4th working day. He state that he has been working three days plus the twelve and more hours of work that he was doing that day. The manager than said that if he was tired was just because he was not taking good care of himself and that he was disrespecting the passengers by refusing to operate the flight back because they wouldn’t be able to fly to PMI because of him. He than replied that it would be disrespectful to the passengers if he would operate a flight when he’s not fit to and not mentally or physically capable anymore to guaranty the safety of the flight and the passengers.

The second cabin crew who spoke with her was the N4. The cabin crew explained to her the situation telling that she was already flying on the day off as a FLEXI day and she was not fit to operate any flight anymore as it would be against safety procedures. Then the manager replied putting pressure on the N4 asking her if she was willing to disappoint the passenger for just 15min of discretion. (At the beginning when we landed we were expecting 15min of discretion that already at that time after all the waiting where increased). 

She then spoke to the N1 asking her to convince her crew to operate the flight back, so she asked again the crew and we all agree together once agin that the flight wouldn’t be safe anymore if operated by us because we were not fit to fly anymore and also there was no water suitable for drinking available onboard for neither passengers or cabin crew. So she report to the manager the decision and the manger intimidated the all crew by telling her that if they would refuse to operate the flight back they would be scheduled for a meeting in DUB the day after. 
The phone call ended with the crew taking the intimidation and still refusing for safety reason to operate the flight back.

[2018-07-09 16:18:59] <nilsholdrinet> The captain called operations asking to fly back empty as the flight crew still felt fit to fly. Operations informed the captain that DUB wanted the crew to overnight in CGN and go to DUB the day after for a meeting. Then the crew left the aircraft and went to the crew room to call crew control to know the details about the overnight and the flights for the day after.
We were informed that our flight to DUB the day after would have been at 05:55z to MAN and then from there to DUB at 11:00z. After receiving all this informations and knowing that neither the hotel or the lift to this one was arrange we were questioning to crew control about our rest period. We got as answer that the flights and the meeting in DUB the day after were not consider as duty so the proper rest time was not needed. 
After being waiting a at the airport for at least another hour we decide to call crew control again as calculating all the time to reach the hotel and the time to come back we had left only 4h sleeping. We got once again the same answer and we’ve also been told that we could refuse to come to the meeting but that may had repercussions. At this point we just gave up and after waiting another 15min we reach the hotel in CGN at 02:15L.

[2018-07-09 22:00:46] <boswellbrown> Fredrick, it’s the body of evidence that’s slowly growing. There is serious inertia in the system. It’s a bit like that little leak in a dam. Can’t hold forever

[2018-07-10 00:46:46] <andy.airamerica> The flightdeck crew that thought it would be acceptable to effectively "dump" their cabin crew in CGN and fly back to base are a disgrace. This is not UNITY. Your crew are telling you they are not fit to fly and exercise discretion, you stick together as a crew for fuck sake. 
[2018-07-10 00:50:02] <andy.airamerica> Also, If that Captain past his phone over to each crew member to be spoken to by management that is another thing that is a disgrace. You are the senior ranking staff member on board your aircraft, YOU SPEAK FOR THE CREW! Not pass the phone over for them to be bullied and intimidated. Unbelievable.

I’d like to acknowledge all those contractors who through no fault of their own but due to management design and the poor labour laws of this country, must report for duty tomorrow. Rest assured, that what we do tomorrow is for YOU. We do it to bring an end to the practice of bogus self employment and abuse of the system. We do it for the betterment of ALL our futures. You too will play a part tomorrow. You will do so by demonstrating to whatever managers are present and to the passengers that you fly, that you DO support us and that you do this by showing them we are not glorified taxi drivers, but professional pilots, dedicated to providing the highest level of safety and service to those passengers. Wear your yellow lanyard with pride and know that we are grateful for you representing us and our profession, on the line. United, even when divided :reminder_ribbon:

[2018-07-11 12:22:22] <jgrooney> These media outlets really don’t know the half of it . The power of contractual gagging orders on employees to suit the financial powers that be . I wonder how many editors get the phone call from the big bosses ( who get calls from other billionaires club members) to publish these articles to turn the masses against workers . Agh the joys of capitalism . (edited)
[2018-07-11 12:27:52] <pilot> This is not an article but a paid advertisement. 
[2018-07-11 12:38:51] <jgrooney> I see this Bob thanks . However if it’s a customer notice then it should strictly refer to flight information only ,not divulging employees contractual conditions (or fake ones ) . The editor is at fault here for not having a balanced communication. He/She should have removed this staff working conditions info , especially during industrial action times . It’s like a judge allowing a jury to be influenced by one sided opinion . Now we face the wrath of abuse in public if angry misinformed members of the public see us commuting to and from work . I’m glad the Union are holding tough and keeping silent to this childish behaviors by mngt.

[2018-07-12 16:17:15] <garethglennon> Inspiring guys, really! There was a time when all this was impossible, a union in Ryanair, they said it was impossible so many times most of us believed it! 
The road we have all traveled through fear and indifference to reach a point where a strike is carried out is a massive step! 
Now the pilots in Dublin have done it, they know they can do it again and again and again add region after region and the possibility of covering strikes becomes less and less! 
Good contracts and conditions are attainable!

[2018-07-14 11:35:35] <martin.loxbo> From PPRuNe:

“Hello, I am a reader for years, but now I have a question to ask:
Ryanair flight from Dublin to Stuttgart. We sit in the plane for nearly 3 hours. After 20:00 local it was clear to me that we will not reach Stuttgart, due to their hard stance on the 23:00 curfew (noise problems).
But at 20:37 we start rolling, captain says we fly to Stuttgart, but OF COURSE we fly to Frankfurt/Hahn. We arrive in buses at STR at 04:00 the next day.
WHY??
What is the bean counters spreadsheet saying? Too many passengers unaware of their rights (250 EUR you can get due to EU regulations)? Hotel in Dublin too expensive?
I really don't get it :-/“

What’s the legality of not telling the passengers that you’re actually not intending to fly to their destination, when you know about it before leaving the gate? :thinking_face: 
[2018-07-14 11:42:48] <arpadheger1977> There is a difference btw flight diverting or flight cancelled (compansation) (as far as I know!) 
[2018-07-14 11:46:15] <martin.loxbo> My question is should we be comfortable saying “welcome onboard this flight to XXX” when we already know the flight will divert to YYY? 
[2018-07-14 11:51:03] <arpadheger1977> I would not recommand to do it, in the light of keeping your job, or being invited to DUB (depends how much you care) (edited)
[2018-07-14 11:53:44] <padawa> Of course the bean counters are sat behind their desks miles away in DUB nowhere near the Pax! We’re the ones have to look the pax in the eye when a clued up one like this comes up and asks this question, how do we respond??? What would Ops say? Would they encourage us to tell lies?? Shitty position to be in! Is an easy job tho!! :rage: 
[2018-07-14 12:00:14] <masterharkin> Hi Martin,
When you get a chance will you put your picture on your profile. Ta! 
[2018-07-14 12:00:29] <andyappeltans> There is offcourse also the wind to take in account. They might have been tight to make it when thry pushed, and if you see after the push everyone will take out their phones which is then agains regulations. 
[2018-07-14 12:07:57] <martin.loxbo> I have been in this situation and OPS will tell you to keep the passengers in the dark, to avoid extra delays in case some decide not to fly. I can see their reasoning but doesn’t it make it a form of kidnapping? :see_no_evil: 
[2018-07-14 12:13:57] <oliver> I try always to tell my passengers the truth. Same thing for prolongued slots, or diversions.

Sometimes if they get too exhuberant, I will tell them they are free to leave if they wish, they are not in prison, but if the flight departs they will be stuck without compensation, or if there is no handling at the alternate, they are free to leave and get the airport authorities to deal with them how to get out of the terminal.
I learned that telling the truth is always better on the long run.
 
[2018-07-14 12:27:52] <arpadheger1977> Interesting discussion going on here:

	:thinking_face: remco.spelt, cianmurray, coolhand787
[2018-07-14 12:29:24] <martin.loxbo> I think that’s the reasonable thing to do, but it’s clearly not what Ops are expecting in these situations. Another issue is flight plans, is it legal to depart knowing that you will divert because your destination will be closed on arrival? 
[2018-07-14 12:37:42] <oliver> No its not. Legally if you are sure you cant make it, you will need a new flight plan I believe.
Same thing for alternates.
If your first alternate before off block is below minima or closed, you need to have a new flight plan (plog) showing a suitable alternate. The alternate shown on the plogs, are only to be used for inflight rerouting.

A few years ago, one of our colleagues got in trouble with the IAA because during the investigation (he had to declare a fuel emergency), they discovered he took off with a first alternate (on the plog and of course on the filed plan) that was below legal limits.

[2018-07-14 13:46:00] <joostvandenbroek> How’s the crew doing? :fearful: Great job getting that plane on the ground! :muscle: 
[2018-07-14 13:50:11] <joostvandenbroek> I was in this position once, on my CU linecheck! An aircraft went off the runway at destination during the night, it was notam’d to be back open though at our arrival time. I didn’t trust it though and all our pax of course were up to date due to social media! Low and behold we arrive over destination and runway still closed, so diversion it was. :see_no_evil: 
[2018-07-14 16:20:48] <andy.airamerica> :man-facepalming::skin-tone-3: that user by the name Noleave hasn’t a clue :man-facepalming::skin-tone-3: 
[2018-07-14 17:52:43] <andyappeltans> If it is illegal to leave knowing you won't land at the destination than a lot of flights to airports with a curfew are illegal.
Ive hade the situation before that after a delay we were ready for push and the 1st or second to go and then passengers wanted to offload themselves which meant another 2h delay 
[2018-07-14 18:04:35] <andyappeltans> Or over in the sandbox it is a lot worse then here. 
[2018-07-14 18:10:30] <jfitzpatrick485> It’s really incredible, when you look through the various media outlets, just how many fires management are fighting.
1. Dublin pilots Strike
2. Imminent CC strike
3. Imminent German pilots strike 
4. Negative news outlet headlines including 
- Ryanair inflight emergency leaves 33 in hospital 
- Ryanair denies cabin crew fired over fatigue issue
- Ryanair and Lufthansa in row over Laudamotion

When do the stakeholders say ‘enough is enough’, what will it take? How much mis-management, industrial unrest or constant negative publicity can they shoulder?

[2018-07-14 18:20:13] <osmo.kleemola> Most of the cases the airport only has a curfew, but it remains open. You can still land there, but if you do the company gets massive fines. So it is not illegal to have it planned as a destination.

[2018-07-14 18:20:26] <andy.airamerica> and thats not including all the current court cases they are going through. 
[2018-07-14 18:36:35] <oliver> Reminds me a bit like the old adagie, that in Italy it was forbidden to fuel and board passengers until a few years ago.
Completely untrue, it was illegal to fuel and board without the presence of the fire truck near the airplane, the fire brigade was willing to do this extra job but wanted to be rightly compensated for this. 
In RYR this became “forbidden”....lol

Now they lobbied so much that the said the airport agent with a fire extinguisher will be safe enough!!!! (edited)
[2018-07-14 18:36:45] <spac> EK currently have a requirement for an intake of 40 pilots pcm. Their success rate, according to a senior trainer, is -20pcm.
DEC without relevant WB experience, is being stopped at VP level, the same fellow, apparently, who scrapped a recent payrise.
They are SO short of flight deck, their ULH crew have been reduced by 25%, to a complement of 3.
Applications for annual leave are turned down, whatever the season/month. Owing to recent increases in local taxes, to return to a financial level of a couple of years ago, there would need to be a 15% payrise.
The company has resorted to take on locals, with the implied problems of an authority gradient from the right seat.
There have been several unpublished close-calls, owing to a variety of issues. One which springs to mind was apparently on approach to DME. The 400' @ 8 miles disaster averted by the GPWS....

[2018-07-14 19:56:23] <brendanjacobs> This was a comment from one of the pax onboard the a/c into Hann “Ms Galvan commended the cabin crew for their professionalism during the emergency landing but said on arrival at the airport "they were forgotten about" by the airline.” Says it all really. There are two parts to Ryanair, the business, based at HQ in Swords and the airline. It’s their job to keep the profits safe, or so they seem to think anyway. It’s ours to keep the airline safe. We do our best everyday as frontline staff, from check in to baggage handling, engineers to cabin crew, the whole machine works to ensure the airline runs safely and efficiently. This is a difficult task for any airline, but for ours, it’s a completely different ball game. Extreme cost cutting allowing for gpu’s that go up in flames if someone flushes a toilet, no staff to ensure our passengers can safely make it into the terminal from the a/c, a pressure from above that pushes people to rush around like they’re infected with some sort of raging virus, resulting in collisions between equipment and a/c and very sadly, a possible contributing factor to the death of a ramp agent in Lisbon. The holes are lining up everywhere, soon there will be no cheese left, just thin air. The firing of those cabin crew for DOING THEIR JOB is a despicable act carried out by a team of managers who it seems have lost all sense of reality in their incessant pursuit of profit and greed. Time for them to go. Enough is enough.

For the older/geeky amongst us, I present:
Marty McFly jr.
Of Irish descent. And he, too, finds himself standing up to a bully and his henchmen, throughout history. But to rectify the problems in his life he doesn't use a Teleporter, but a flying timemachine. He needs it to create a better future for him and his family, because of the mess, problems and mistakes that the bullies made.
In the 2nd movie he actually admits: yes sir, I'm a Slacker!

Now we all find ourselves standing up to our bully. Fighting for a better future for ourselves, our families, and our colleagues. When the time comes, will you stand up and stand your ground, like the Irish and German crews before us? Will you be proud to say:
Yes, sir, I'm a Slacker!! attachments: [{"service_name":"YouTube","service_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/","title":"\"You're a Slacker!\" Back to the Future- Mr. Strickland Scene","title_link":"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=3ndJNXCkNxg","author_name":"ecavallari","author_link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ecavallari","thumb_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3ndJNXCkNxg\/hqdefault.jpg","thumb_width":480,"thumb_height":360,"fallback":"YouTube Video: \"You're a Slacker!\" Back to the Future- Mr. Strickland Scene","video_html":"<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3ndJNXCkNxg?feature=oembed&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","video_html_width":400,"video_html_height":225,"from_url":"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=3ndJNXCkNxg","text":"","service_icon":"https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/2089\/img\/unfurl_icons\/youtube.png","id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=3ndJNXCkNxg"}]

The only way to counter it is to refuse to go to a base you don't want in the first place, since once you're there you know that you're last in the queue to be moved.

I was supposed to take the EI-ENM to STN today however the AC was still unworthy. The engineers have replaced all the air conditioning system components including the FDR, CVR and the outflow valve. The problem was a failure of the CPC (Cabin Pressurization Controller). Boeing recommendation was a.o. to cycle both AC packs to High and to rotate PMS from AUTO to ALTN and vice versa during the ferry flight and monitor system performance.

[2018-07-18 19:41:10] <peterw.mulder> From a STN group:

CTOTs will be assigned at no earlier than EOBT +10. FR Ops Control is in charge of estimating EOBTs, requesting delays, etc. In this particular case, if your EOBT was for example 9:35, you are expected to be ready for OffBlocks at 9:35, ATFM (Eurocontrol) can automatically move your CTOT forward (until 9:45 earliest) depending on the current traffic situation and regardless Ready Message was sent or not. Technically, in this particular day, if you were not ready to comply with your EOBT (which I am not aware what it was), you should have requested a delay message, otherwise we run the risk of missing a CTOT improvement. On the other hand, a delay message could cause a CTOT change... I would recommend you to ask the dispatcher or the tower what your EOBT is for better SA and planning. What you CAN do, is to reject a CTOT improvement by sending (dispatcher through RYR OPS) a “SRJ” (Slot Improvement Proposal Rejection Message) For the next time, if you know that you won’t meet the EOBT, but you are happy with the CTOT, you can change your Flighy Status from “RFI” (Ready for Improvement) to “SWM” (Slot Wanted Message) This can only be done through RYR OPS. You can refer to the “ATFCM USERS MANUAL (Eurocontrol)” for detailed info.

[2018-07-18 20:06:20] <bkehoe00> The -5/+10 is at ATC discretion; you need to be ready for takeoff at CTOT time. Unfortunately you may have been able to be at the holding point but ATC in STN may have already planned a departure/arrival sequence and by accommodating you at the furthest window of the CTOT could cause someone else to miss a slot or mean holding arrival traffic. Personally I myself would be asking ground what the latest time they’ll let us push if I know there’s an issue with the turnaround and then if necessary get the delay message in earlier so at least the new slot isn’t as bad.  
	:+1: george.edgeworth, jrr5b5, joshuabowers1
[2018-07-18 20:19:58] <oliver> Thank you Brendan, 
makes sense I guess. We had a 1 hour turn around and missed the ctot, ended up having a two hour slot. ATC accomodated a push and hold, and was actually very helpful in improving the situation.

The problem we have is that we have very tight long 4 sectors, with STN rostered flights, and you allready know you will go in discretion, leaving at first wave. Had to declare two discretions in three flying days.
I used to be based in STN in 2006, but I dont remember so many issues back than.:wink:AGB 
[2018-07-18 21:27:55] <bkehoe00> Yeah it’s frustrating and know what you mean, here we have a STN/Something on early shift and it usually ruins the whole day for the early and late crew on that a/c. You’re right, STN was fine up till around 2 years ago. I never cease to be amazed at the efficiency of ATC in STN though; especially the departure traffic sequencing. The self improving slot in general has caught me out a few times when already running late and suddenly slot improves to off blocks +10 and then we miss it and end up waiting for a new one. Peter, do you know if anyone’s ever tried asking ATC to send a SRJ message to stop this happening?

[2018-07-24 05:53:10] <andyappeltans> You cant make these stories up.
Planned to fly with a captain oob. At checking noone here so start calling crew control. 
On the meantime on a whatsapp group i get a message that the flight will be delayed because they are picking it up after diverting the night before. And the aircraft is doing a different flight first.
I reply saying it is a different aircraft but i am missing the captain.
The captain that is supposed to fly with me is now at the other airport waiting for the aircraft...

[2018-07-24 09:05:06] <tuhhodge> Doesn't surprise me. I was sent OOB for two days, with the Day 1 commute preceding a 4 sector day and my Day 3 commute home preceding a 2 sector day commencing 50 minutes after the scheduled landing time. Needless to say, it went wrong! The Day 3 commuting flight was delayed by 5 hours because the aircraft was sent on 2 extra sectors to cover strike cancellations. Neither I nor my Co-pilot could get through to Dublin to ask what they planned to do about the fact I was stuck in another country due to their 'planning'. My Co-pilot and cabin crew sat aboard the aircraft, thankfully without pax, for 4 hours waiting for me. In the end I got through to Ops (still impossible to get Crew Control on the line) just as my delayed commuting flight left the stand, and told them I would be unfit to operate the return leg due to FTLs or they'd need to book a hotel at the destination, and within 10 minutes my original flight was cancelled. Nobody bothered to tell my crew, sitting on the aircraft (Swissport don't know anything about anything) who only found out by going into the terminal and checking the boards 40 minutes later.

She came then... she was off the day before and far away from 100h limit so she came for the 4 sectors! Any thoughts or comment about it? Thank you:+1: happy to share any experience here (edited)

Most if not all of our contracts of employments stipulate that we are forbidden to use social media. DO NOT engage with, for example, disgruntled passengers who are venting their frustrations at the company. I know its tempting but PLEASE STAY OFF COMMENTS SECTIONS ON WEBSITES AND DO NOT GET INTO A "WAR OF WORDS" WITH A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC.

See a post on media thread . Possibly not by individual but from media managers we employ or a single point of comment like Norwegian pilot group. Staying silent is not an option. Just saying .

[2018-07-27 15:45:55] <nilsholdrinet> The quarterly report for when the strikes were on hasn't been released yet. This is Q1, when no industrial actions were taking place.

[2018-07-27 15:51:37] <andy.airamerica> Correct Nils. When Q2 is released and shows even further losses then with two quarterly losses my guess is the allowances and bonuses (or whatever they've called them) that were offered under new base deals at the end of last year will all be pulled.

[2018-07-27 20:21:03] <andy.airamerica> I'm no stock broker either but this is my understanding.....A company buys back its own shares for a number of reasons. For example, if a company buys back its own shares it leaves fewer shares available for others to buy which pushes the price up. Another reason is when the share price falls it can be bought at a cheaper price so when the share price rises again the shares are worth more. 
[2018-07-27 20:31:31] <tomflood737> As Ryanair have issued Protective Notice to 100 Dublin Based Pilots with various threats including *redundancy.*

[2018-07-27 21:52:47] <jgrooney> Any ideas pls how to get a letter from HQ to get flying hrs and a report for non incidents in order to prepare for redundancy . They have put one in the chamber , so I need to prepare to move on if I’m one of the chosen ones to get it in the back of the head . Before in late 2007 , I just walked ...but I see airlines require more flt hrs evidence now . Time to let the company know the significance of their definite redundancy threat letter and it’s consequences. If enough pilots and cabin crew do the same request through the Union , then they and the personnel staff know we see the letter for what it is and they can suffer the consequences of yet Another possible loss of qualified pilots and cabin crew when they are pilot and cabin crew short . The shareholders need to know this too !

Hi XXXX, 

How are you?

It would be myself who would release these letters, but as per company policy these letters would not be released until successful completion of notice period / last date of flight.

Unfortunately I am not authorised to release letters any sooner than this date.

If you would like to contact your FOPS Bases Manager to see if there is anything that can be done or if there is another letter than can be released, they can be contacted via zendesk query.

Regards,

Lorraine 
[2018-07-28 07:07:48] <boswellbrown> Just had a look through both the Irish and uk government websites. I believe companies are meant to assist you in retraining, offering new position and giving you time off to seek new work. It doesn’t say as much but I’d assume Ryanair would be on very dodgy legal grounds if it did anything but assist you. Imagine going before a judge and trying to justify not helping a staff member find alternative employment when you’ve specifically said you don’t need them anymore! Bear mind this is before the flimsy circumstance outlined anyway which may be a whole other box of frogs they’ll have to deal with.

[2018-07-29 06:23:26] <brendanjacobs> Given that management are prepared to entice new people with all sorts of goodies including sign on bonus, choice of Base and no bond. They should insist on the removal of the probation period from their contract. Then join the fight!

Couldn't possible take the aircraft as it was and was eventually swoped onto another aircraft. The late  cork stn round trip cancelled last night.  Early STN cancelled this morning from Cork.

[2018-07-30 11:49:21] <jgrooney> I feel sorry for the staff in there under mngts’s pressure of being fired if they don’t get results . One cabin crew working in cc had only one toilet break and ate at her desk each day for full 12 hr shifts . :rage:

[2018-07-30 11:52:44] <remco.spelt> @jgrooney is it even legal in Ireland to put an CC with what I have heard like 30min training in such an position with 1 toilet break for 12 hrs?

[2018-07-30 11:57:57] <jgrooney> I was thinking that way Adam :thinking_face:. I think they are not following normal proper mngt ways . Anyone can manage a company that gets its life blood from constant expansion without putting any money Back into the business and upkeep of proper staff levels with good industrial relations . The idea that you can save on staff costs to balance other costs like fuel is madness . Can’t get a one horsepower engine to pull a 100 tonne load . They have over cooked the system and now it’s damage limitation . 
To ask them to switch mngt style and put 300 million euros back into the business( a 150 million would have done last year)  would be proper mngt ... something they can’t do . Something they won’t give in to . I suspect there is a lot of personal funds put into RYR Sun and LMotion and they must survive at all costs . With the greatest of respect to pax on RS , they don’t spend onboard anywhere near what the average spend say ex DUB . That’s one  discussion point that can be heard in work . 
Shareholders are very smart and will have hedged their bets in a few runners ...investing in Easy, BA, RYR, Norwegian etc . They will always win but our mngt think they’ve only invested in RYR ( narcissism) ... scrimping on payouts to keep up profit levels and shore up the share price with share buybacks . The only thing that’ll save this company is to start with treating staff with full respect , normal industry standard terms and conditions in CLA’s AND put the hand in the pocket rapidly to sort out this mess . (edited)
[2018-07-30 12:04:52] <jgrooney> That’s what I heard from someone in the know Remco . I don’t know if it’s fully true about the one toilet break though , but I’d say they are under so much pressure , it’s frowned upon to be away from the desk for too many breaks . 
Absolutely Pablo . I’m calm and respectful too like you , until they get disrespectful or cheeky . Then I ask them to safeguard the recording for future complaints . We all need respect.

[2018-08-01 11:43:29] <oliver> @leonardo.chistolini I guess in a theoretical way you are right, but am I really? If I quit Anpac, my voice will not be heard and on top of that I will not be able to vote on the “cla” that Anpac is pushing on all italian pilots. 
If Anpac would allow all italian pilots to vote and RTPG and ECA would allow me to join another union to reppresent me in Italy I will do it immediately. Unfortunately Anpac has signed an exclusivity with RYR to be the only union “allowed” to negotiate with the company..... very fair.:thinking_face:

On the other side I am not mad about Anpac, I am mad about how they are dealing with their members.
Same as I am not mad with RYR, (I actually want RYR to prosper), I am upset with the way they are threating us. Could you plead to Anpac to allow other unions to the negotiation table?
Could you ask them to be democratic enough to allow all of us to vote on the agreement, under the supervision of RTPG? (edited)

OMA states that for 4 sectors my max FDP without discretion is 11:30.

Does ECDR require any interaction or does it auto submit a report because I didn’t “do” anything with it and it doesn’t show anything on that page.

Or have I just misunderstood something there.

	:man-facepalming: remco.spelt, cianmurray
[2018-08-02 14:47:12] <boswellbrown> The interesting thing is they’re furiously buying shares in the market yet even a not too large a portion of the €750 million allocated to this endeavour if spent on staff would do far more to improve share price or growth. They still fundamentally don’t get the fact that investing in people has a positive return. Victorian to mid 1900’s management mentality! 
Having read various analyst notes, I’d  second the view that that many investors haven’t got a scoobi about what’s actually going on.

2. Absolute piece of :hankey:, assuming there will be picket lines who will block people going to work... Mayby the CRL area isn't that safe itself but we pilots are all respectfull persons (I believe) and would never deny a person it's right to go to work....

[2018-08-04 14:23:11] <remco.spelt> <https://investor.ryanair.com/share-price/>

All share prices from "compititor airlines" higher then Ryanair, when are the investors gonna say ENOUGH.... :mantelpiece_clock: :point_up:  
[2018-08-04 19:09:31] <boston58730> I would imagine they are getting close to boiling point now. 

I think the market will wait and see how the mediation goes and when he screws that up the price will free fall (due to co-ordinated strikes making Europe-wide news)

Even when ANPAC accepts the crumbs being offered and signs their deal, I don’t think the market will care much because the average punter doesn’t know how important Italy is to Ryanair. In any case Italian Crew have already shown that they wield enough power to seriously hamper the operation there and since they tend to be younger and more attractive than pilots, they garner a lot more attention from the press.

[2018-08-05 06:49:50] <squaadgras> Indeed it is correct that certain trends are industry related, however FR share price is currently going *against* the markets. Obviously a direct result of tensions between FR and the unions, and management’s inability to reach a quick deal. Investor confidence :chart_with_downwards_trend:. 
[2018-08-05 08:12:38] <tomflood737> I totally agree with Sören, before the September fiasco the shares were heading north based on Ryanair’s plans to expand and the fact they can keep pumping our money back in the form of share buybacks.  
[2018-08-05 09:53:48] <johnnymurt> Will Ryr be allowed to publish the same flight listings next year as they have in 17 and 18, despite clearly not having enough of a workforce to cover the schedule.  If they are made to reduce the schedule we may just get to see single figures again.  Could be wrong and it might happen next week as a few more roundabouts are filled.  Proud of you guys.   
[2018-08-05 09:54:18] <masterharkin> The growth issue has a huge part to play. EasyJet showed first quarter growth of :heavy_plus_sign::four::five:% and we showed a slump of :heavy_minus_sign::two::zero:%. That’s a 65% growth gap in 3 months. We can’t continue to watch our competitor race away without us. 
[2018-08-05 10:00:27] <davobrodlie> But RYR will come back &amp; say that EZY isn’t a competitor airline...stupidly :upside_down_face::man-facepalming::skin-tone-2: 
[2018-08-05 12:13:23] <fergus.cassidy> Anyone who takes a passenger form you is a competitor. And in fairness RYR actually gave EZY a free hand by messing up so much. The true figures will show in the next quarter. Also they should have split those shares like they did about 10 years ago. It's makes them more affordable. And also shows a smaller drop. A €1 drop in value on a €7 share doesn't seem as big as a €2 fall on a €14 share. It's the same percentage but sounds less for the ordinary inverstor.
The large investor sees millions lost at the present with a much smaller dividend payment. Ryanair at its present value is ripe for a hostile takeover with its 30% devaluation in the last 12 month's. 
[2018-08-05 19:19:38] <ramseyersimon> That’s not the way it works , based on the growth since then , the share price has completely tanked .

[2018-08-10 20:50:17] <kilroyrobin> I was the Captain of this flight, the fire truck salute was not for my retirement. One day if I’m so lucky it will be. In fact we were opening Glasgow base, no irony there then, all things come to an end. 

In my mind the key to the tougher times in life and the question of how to find a way forward is very often to imagine how you will look back on this time. 

I see a lot of people who march today with the uncertainty that comes with this fight now like a familiar companion to them. Some ok with that, some fighting that, and some just resigned to that as the cost of standing your ground. 

How we will be dealing with this a season or two from now is hard to predict. But one thing is clear to me, when the season of our lives turns to autumn, the last landing is logged, the cannon salute is a memory and there is time again to watch the leaves fall then there will be not one of us who marched a picket line today that looks back upon this time without pride. 

I’m not talking about the pride you fight over, this is the pride we fight for. Pride as people, pride as a profession. Pride in ourselves for respect that is earned. 

Never forget that these days now are the good old days. I defy you not to to call these days the good old days - one day. The only question is when will you call them that. Why not now.

[2018-08-12 09:37:32] <matthewwilson> Michael O'Leary is paid more than the CEOs of  Lufthansa, IAG, EayJet...

If his salary is based on 'being a CEO', rather than 'being the CEO of a low cost company,' why shouldn't ours?

We are the most productive pilots in the Europe, if not the world. Surely we should have better T&amp;Cs than our colleagues at Lufthansa etc as a reward for our hard work and commitment to facilitating the success. (edited)

Ask the question first though, is this a late duty. Once confirmed, you can state in accordance with base agreement etc. It’s arguable though as it’s an early standby that happens to have a duty assigned within FTL’s

Thanks Adam if this very precise and thoroughly thought out analysis of the Italian ANPAC ‘agreement’! Great efforts went into the writing of this document! Thank you to those involved! I believe this will be an eye opener to our Italian Colleagues to vote NO. Essential to us fellow colleagues is to spread it as far and wide to our Italian fellow RYR pilots, BY ALL means available 
[2018-08-18 09:23:00] <fergus.cassidy> Message from @chrisvanroyen  moved to thread.

Is it possible to change your vote once you have submitted it? 
Maybe some colleagues will change their minds after seeing this document and other arguments they have heard the last few days to vote NO instead of yes. 
[2018-08-18 09:32:03] <oliver> That was one of our concerns, we voice to Anpac.
We wanted the secret wip cla once approved for ballot, do be released a few weeks in order to be analyzed than to open the ballott to all italian pilots. Of course they refused. 
[2018-08-18 09:34:05] <oliver> I think UIL did an excellent work in producing and releasing this document. 
[2018-08-18 09:41:46] <chrisvanroyen> Agree Oliver, its an excellent Document.
Did all CC members agree to this CLA? Or was it the majority of the CC members who voted yes to the CLA?

[2018-08-18 10:47:22] <sam.vanherzele> @chrisvanroyen, it was majority of the company council who were in favour. Not all CC members agreed unanimously. Some (including me) voiced their opinion for the last couple of months but were mostly ignored by the negotiating team and anpac board.

*The proposed Italian CLA is akin to putting a roof on a house with no foundation, the roof is made of the wrong material and it’s already developing holes and won’t last a couple of seasons.*

*Strong Foundations is where we all need to start - it’s not too late, it’s not too late*

[2018-08-20 12:05:11] <adamtruran> Just received an update from ECA for us contractors in Poland;
 
New legislation means that workers in Poland employed using more flexible, task-based ‘civil law contracts’ will be entitled to join or form trade unions and to benefit from protection previously reserved for trade union members

On 5 July 2018 the Polish Parliament adopted amendments to the Act on Trade Unions and certain other acts. According to the new provisions, from January 2019, individuals in Poland who provide paid work on a basis different from a conventional employment relationship will have the right to create and join trade unions, and to benefit from certain trade union privileges.

In principle in Poland, work may be provided under an employment contract or a ‘civil law contract’. Civil law contracts are not regulated by the Labour Code and are more flexible than conventional employment agreements. They include contracts of mandate, where an employer wants to hire a worker to perform a particular action without entering into an employment agreement, and contracts for specific work, which are structured around and remunerated for the completion of specific work. Until now, civil law workers were not covered by the Act on Trade Unions. The types of working arrangement covered by the new rules include both contracts of mandate and contracts for specific work

Workers employed on civil law contracts will not only get the right to create and join trade unions, but will also be entitled to privileges stemming from union membership that have so far been restricted to employees. By way of example, they will have the right to be released from work with remuneration, or to special protection against termination. Where a contract with a contractor who is a trade union official is terminated without the approval of the union, the employer may have to pay a severance payment amounting to six months’ remuneration. The amount of this payment will be a lump sum, unrelated to the loss suffered. However, if the contractor’s loss is higher, they will be able to pursue damages or compensation in excess of the standard severance payment.

The changes will come into force on 1 January 2019.

It flies from the mast of every active Indonesian war ship. The design of the jack is described as nine alternating stripes of red and white.

[2018-08-22 09:06:37] <peter.j.marriott> This is quite interesting. I am one of “those” guys. Joined RYR a year ago, got my base I demanded. On a roster that works for me and home every night. After 20 years, multiple airlines, multiple continents including Asia, 18 years of commuting, I used the pilot shortage to MY favour, now I fully understand the teams are working hard to make changes in RYR, however I cannot help but feel that the time is fast approaching where the power is slowly slipping out of the hands of the Unions. In a few short weeks the peek summer season will be over, the advantage lost. The same problems will be hot topics, BUT I can assure you, pilots like myself from around the world will continue to join RYR because THEY are taking advantage of the pilot shortage. I would suggest the unions get ruthless. My ten cents.

[2018-08-23 21:50:39] <kilroyrobin> Mediation is something I hardly understood a short time ago, Now that I have been through it I understand some things I had not known before. The mediator is independent but fair. He is not more on your side, unless you are more fair. Nobody in the room knows the end result until the end, maybe the mediator, but only maybe. No snap shots are possible in the complex web of guesses and hints. The cards are only played at the end, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

Sometimes you are in one room, sometimes in 3 rooms. Sometimes you face your foe to serve a function, some times it serves no function. Poker faces, role play, guessing what was hinted, holding cards to your chest only to play at the last, while the other side does so too, if they will ever be played.

You will have to surrender some of what you hold to gain what you don’t. You may bluff and loose and bluff and win, you can push your luck and loose your luck, a fine line sets the two apart.

You have to know your team, you need to know the strengths and weaknesses of your own people, and know the same of your opposition. Try to play yours to win and theirs to loose, all while they play the same game.

In the air you juggle the endless hints at what they may yield once they find out what you can yield, you play points to win prizes, you play keen to keep things moving, but not too keen or you are loosing. They play the same.

The mediator plays both sides for the common ground, the common ground is his prize, ground lost is easy, ground won is hard.

If we leave now is it lost for good, will we ever get here again, if the ball lands on the table will our side grab it when its there, because it may not land there a second time. What of the others abroad, will they understand? no they won’t - not until they have been here. Even our President stepped back and said, I can’t know the answers now, only those in the room can call it, and so we called it.

Why does it go on for 5 days or 23 hours, how can the most critical decisions by made in a state of collateral exhaustion, I could never understand this until I was there. In the desperation of every possible avenue exhausted juggled in your minds, the prizes won or are they lost, both sides reach for the pen and sign in the end, it’s just to make the pain end in some ways but all while knowing it will have only just begun if you have got it wrong, if people walk away now and think then they will or may never sign, desperately holding on to the one question.

Can we take this to the members.

“No country for old men”, but yet the elders do it best, no game for pilots, no a place for SOP’s, fact and fiction are just as powerful, not a game for me. A game for ‘us’ in the end, a game played by every one of us who walked the line this summer and gave our voice to Mediation.

[2018-08-24 12:03:12] <tuhhodge> Their issue with undocumented jumpseaters seemed reasonable, unless there's more to it, which may be the case, though you do wonder why the same rigid adherence to rules doesn't apply to red bags full of loot?  
[2018-08-24 12:09:42] <nilsholdrinet> From what I've been told there's more to it Tom. The comparison to the Seattle incident is especially low.  
[2018-08-24 12:53:53] <brendanjacobs> Tom all I’ll say is that history has taught us that what comes out of management’s mouth is generally bullshit or a complete distortion of the truth.

[2018-08-24 13:26:22] <jorgelucca> Thanks 
[2018-08-24 17:34:53] <coolhand787> I agree with Brendan, RYR memos or decisions are always based on MONEY or COVERING THEMSELVES! They are the tip of the iceberg. The messages perceived here are: 1.) be careful follow SOP’s or you could be dismissed! 2.) RYR always primary concern is SAFETY and SECURITY! This is window dressing maybe for IAA or EASA starting to poke their nose into RYR affairs. In any case this last statement is contradicted by RYR management behaviors on fatigue/maintenance/roster stability etc. So remain vigilant and as Brendan said: FOCUS on sorting out our issues! Don’t be blinded/sidetracked by some more BS from PB 
[2018-08-24 18:19:03] <ajraghunanan> Hey guys, quick question, not sure if I’m in the right category, but what is the deal with this PBN certificate they have been going on about in emails, was it supposed to be mailed to us or something? 
[2018-08-24 18:22:36] <adamtruran> You needed to pick it up from your BC Allister. That was a few weeks ago anyway now. Not sure if you need to get the IAA to send you one if your BC hasn’t got yours 
[2018-08-24 18:23:20] <damiano.detomassi> Can’t operate from tomorrow without .  
[2018-08-24 18:24:09] <robertgormley53> If u are based in Dub it should've been collected from the cabin crew office, assuming you completed the Moodle stuff. I think there was a memo or email out about contacting the IAA directly to collect, if you haven't got it 
[2018-08-24 18:30:19] <ajraghunanan> Thanks for the replies, Oh, wow, I haven’t got mine, I thought we would be told directly when to collect it, and I never heard anything. Does this mean I am affectively unavailable for duty until I can contact the IAA on Monday then? 
[2018-08-24 18:30:47] <ajraghunanan> I was on my 4 days off and only just read 3,2,1 days to go emails 
[2018-08-24 18:42:58] <robertgormley53> If it were me, I'd ask that question to crew control  
[2018-08-24 18:50:23] <ajraghunanan> Ok thanks

They are closed until Monday . (edited)

And even more than that we all have our self respect. There was a great comment from @danieltierney1 today in our meetings which struck me and stuck with me. It was about the camaraderie and friendships borne of all this and all of us in. People sticking around the crew room chatting, young cadets in yellow lanyards proud to be a part of all of us, and all of us proud to have them. It really is a great time to be in Ryanair. Now the child of Unity is borne it must be raised by all of us.

[2018-08-25 00:59:44] <kilroyrobin> I just ran it through google translate, this came back:-
“Warm greetings dear friends and fellow employees. Today a man dropped a sweet wrapper which fell from his back pocket. Also in Alaska in 1989 thirty thousand metric tonnes of crude oil was spilled into prince William Sound from the Exxon Valdez by its drunk Captain who hit a rock. As you can see littering is obviously very very bad. The man with the reckless sweet wrapper incident has therefore had his employment terminated.” (edited)

[2018-08-25 23:17:25] <shirley.gallon> I'm glad you're all as confused as I was by that utterly bizarre memo. It's like they're saying , ... .... 
oh hello pilots it's Thursday or Friday or whatever... And while you're all sitting comfortably there, we'd like to remind you that you need to always be on tender hooks . Don't ever let down your guard. Be afraid . Be very afraid. We will sack you. Someone anyway. Most weeks. And we'll tell you all about it. Although we won't really tell you what really happened . We'll just hopefully leave you confused and afraid. Good that's settled then. 
Have a nice day y'all.

[2018-08-26 08:47:33] <boston58730> So why did I just +1 the newsroom’s call for a yes vote when I have not seen the agreement?

Because over these last months on Slack I feel like I have got to know what makes frequent contributors tick. Not what they like for breakfast or their taste in women/men/cars or bikes but their values in work-life, politics and justice.

The mere fact that contractors are given a vote, let alone included in the MSL tells me that I am right about Tom, Fergus, Robin et al and so I commend this proposal to the house!

[2018-08-27 21:12:24] <squaadgras> Coincidence :point_up:. 
[2018-08-27 21:23:59] <noelintogher> Home from four days out of base in Poland. Finally got to a meeting today to get some details from IRL CC about our agreement from the mediation. The Lads have achieved a tremendous amount from a ferocious adversary. Not only for Irish pilots but for every pilot in the company from literally the day he or she started with ryanair. Lots of contract stuff, lots of industrial  relations speak and when its component parts are added together the answer to the reason we walked the roundabout.
They have just laid a base layer on the runway to normality for pilots working in this company.
We should not be complacent and expect that the agreement will just be voted through. It will, I have no doubt. But it would show great support for the work of the negotiating team if every single Ryanair IALPA member, both employee and contractor utilise their right to vote and have their say. The implementation of this agreement will affect us all....I guess I can put the Polish language tapes away for the moment :))   Well done to all involved. :+1:

[2018-08-28 00:34:59] <brendanjacobs> Contractors in particular should vote. No more will the company be able to talk about ‘the 25%’. When they see that it’s much closer to ‘100%’  of us backing this movement for a better future they’ll shit themselves. Management and the media will be able to see the true form and size of this beast named Unity! Get your vote sent back in ASAP.

[2018-08-28 08:46:37] <boston58730> Like a lot of us, a major part of what I am fighting for is an end to crappy OOB in a crappy FR hotel and fighting over transport. Since I am a realist I know that the Ryanair model will struggle to work if we had all managed to organise OOB according to seniority and insist on decent quality hotels and company provided transport.

Considering there are no such provisions in ANPAC’s agreement, today is not a total loss. The company will now be able to accede to RTPGs demands knowing full well that they can crew bases with OOB ANPAC members who one can only assume have no issue with OOB. 

I would have preferred that we walk this road together but I do understand that some people have different priorities. At least the rest of us (including UIL) can now forge ahead with our vision of what a dignified pilot career should look like.

I hold no grudge against ANPAC and her members and wish you every success.

[2018-08-29 10:49:03] <bertstaelens> Thank you 
[2018-08-29 10:51:42] <boston58730> Fantastic start. Well done guys. Something I can show off on the flight deck of what we can achieve. 
[2018-08-29 11:02:57] <fourdonks> Thanks. I guess Balpa will have their own take on it. I assume from point 3) "you have what you hold" - that transfer requests which have been sitting in the current transfer system will be processed first, irrespective of DoJ. There does also seem to be the assumption that DECs have been getting any base they wanted. Not me - I was firmly told when I joined 3 years ago, absolutely nothing in the uk - so I had to do time in Italy (nice as it was) and am still not at either of my base choices - this would appear to be putting those (popular) bases out of reach for the foreseeable if my long awaited base request counts for nothing. Fair in a way, but quite a rug pull for DECs. (edited)
[2018-08-29 11:29:42] <kilroyrobin> You will remain in the queue under the current system until 31st Dec 2019 or until the current queue is exhausted, whichever is first. Then Seniority will decide, by which time you will have a good bit of seniority. What has been happening this year is DEC’s have had absolute priority over you and everyone else. This is now tamed to ‘one for one’ which is a considerable improvement. The mediator would not accept our intention to remove the DEC queue jump altogether in respect of FRs inability to recruit and fill seats in unpopular bases. He accepted that there is no market for Marrakesh pilots for example. This is the reality of mediation - it’s got us a much better deal, but not a perfect deal.  
	:+1: gustav.andregard, garethglennon, jgrooney
[2018-08-29 11:33:32] <fourdonks> Thank you. I doubt I'll get either base before then, so I'll be stuck as one of the most junior captains in the bidding for three to four years with upgraders coming in above, compared to the current seat based system) but at least we'll have a proper seniority system. (edited)
[2018-08-29 11:35:41] <kilroyrobin> I’m glad you say so, incredibly difficult to please everyone in this.  
	:point_up: dohpau, scotthemeryck
[2018-08-29 11:38:32] <damiano.detomassi> is date of joining regarding the first time one joined or the time when he got contract ? There is few people contractor then contract then contractor and some people contract then contractor then now contract again. At some stage was said that numbers of years / months in the company would seem more fair as some people have multiple date of entry . But since I don’t know details I am wondering :-) (edited)
[2018-08-29 11:40:23] <kilroyrobin> It is first day of ground school regardless of contract.  
[2018-08-29 11:41:09] <kilroyrobin> Breaks up to 6 months will probably be ignored but this is not defined yet.  
[2018-08-29 11:41:53] <damiano.detomassi> understood   
[2018-08-29 11:42:36] <kilroyrobin> One  purpose here is to encourage retention of experience in FR for the good of all of us here. If people can come and go freely then this purpose is not served.  
[2018-08-29 11:59:00] <damiano.detomassi> Makes sense indeed  
[2018-08-29 12:01:28] <fourdonks> An idea - how about merge the two  - ie. add the "time already waited" on a current base request, to the time since DoJ, (ie create an earlier DoJ, but only wrt. that specific base request - that way, us captains are not chucking down the drain, all the time we've been waiting on the current list). Bear in mind also, that there are very few DECs like myself who aren't already in their first choice, so the overall effect on the seniority based basings is small - but big for me - I made projections based on the being system in force at the time! (edited)
[2018-08-29 12:17:05] <damiano.detomassi> well yes usually when you have a bid for leave / Base , it’s a mix of the 2 , so a senior cpt cannot be allowed to arrive at last minute and scoop up everything and having the others waiting for him to decide (seem that elsewhere ) . A point system is ideal with seniority as big points  
[2018-08-29 12:21:38] <fourdonks> Indeed, it would be a bitter pill to watch a newish Captain apply for a base that another Captain has been waiting years for, and see him immediately get it - binning long standing current base requests at an arbitrary date next year seems extremely unfair. Fine if the MSL has always been in place like BA and everyone's knew the situation when they joined, but problematic if switching over from a pre existing system with very different ground rules The incentive for DEPs now, is to quit Ryanair and come back in their first choice base, because otherwise, they will remain the more junior captain for many years, (due to being bypassed by all upgraders) pretty much unable to switch to any desirable base - Sadly I think that's what I'll have to do when the time comes. The experienced DEFOs who are now upgrading are the ones I feel for, as their penury in an unpopular base will now be much longer than they expected. I doubt we'll get any experienced new recruits with a merged FO/Captain seniority list, as they will know it will take years and years to get the base they want (so instead, the net result will be that all DECs will demand to only join into the first choice prime bases, or not at all, and DEFOs wouldn't join at all). (edited)
[2018-08-29 12:59:41] <jonathantaylor33> Remember lads, there is no 'list' at the moment. Its just what they tell you. With the transparency of this agreement, you'll know exactly where you stand and can plan on when youll return to your choosen base. Who knows, you could be actually No.1 in line according to seniority, and be in quicker than you thought!

[2018-08-29 13:09:30] <kilroyrobin> Don’t ask me to go back in there and re negotiate this all over again, you might have to do that yourself as I have already done my absolute best. This initiative was launched with a letter to MOL on May 17th which was followed by all MA’s bar 1. Your Company Council have already engaged or had opportunity to engage in this process. We also took onboard guidance from several other airlines. The fundamental task of delivering fairness and transparency is negotiated and if the agreement is carried through it will be achieved and monitored. I’m afraid for now we are long past the “what if we do this or that” phase. However one of the fundamental reasons for 3rd party oversight is to address issues and unforeseen problems as we move forward. This is the child of unity and it now has to be raised by the village of MA members. However it’s too late to turn to the mother in the recovery ward and say I didn’t want a blond I wanted a red head. It’s already born. Now we need to be careful to raise it right, and this is where good ideas will have their place in time. To get this over the line Ryanair fundamentally demanded that the system be simple, that is not to say more factors will not play into it in future, but it is what it is for now.

[2018-08-29 14:46:56] <kilroyrobin> The inevitable is unfortunately that someone somewhere will fall between two stools here and that is difficult, however in the order of democracy it gets voted in and then it becomes the best we can do for the most of us. It is good to engage on it, especially as the system evolves in future. After all this belongs to the pilots, and it is for the pilots, as I say it needs to be raised by us over time and that will take the engagement, oversight and dedication of many. One thing we can say however is that where it falls short of someone’s hopes it will not be on fairness or transparency because from here on in it is one rule for all of us. Equally fair and equally unfair.

[2018-08-29 18:53:36] <kilroyrobin> Claudius if your base has no waiting list you might get it. And yes Rob this has to be adopted by all MAs, if people start going off on a tangent and re inventing the wheel, or accepting dual seniority lists for FO &amp; Cpt. despite how hard we fought for a SINGLE LIST for all ranks then we will loose the edge pretty quick in a transnational sense. However a precedence is set of a single list and so there should be no reason to sink below that level.

[2018-08-29 19:52:49] <jgrooney> Robin , it’s amazing to think this time last year we had deep seated worries as to what the future would be for all of us. There was terrible division and total uncertainty as to seniority, salaries , t’s and c’s etc. Now in Ireland we are voting for what I think is a massive step forward that leads the way for other negotiations in ours and other countries, leads the way to discuss salary etc in the future and gives protection for union members to exercise their rights . Many thanks to You, Tom, Andy , Glen and the others for sticking it out under extremely difficult and intimidating negotiations . As you say you can’t expect a newborn to have full muscle tone and perfect speech . We have to all continue to communicate to strengthen unity and raise this newborn . After all , this certainty will not only benefit us but also the company , by which will protect us all and our jobs in the next big economic downturn . A new management team in the company may take this agreement and build on it further perhaps ? Some shareholders were reported to have said ... to let them strike for as long as they want or worse to shut the company down for several weeks to hit them in the pocket . This agreement let’s the company have some room for further expansion but overall I think the pilots have a sound foundation on which to move forward with . Thanks again Robin et al :reminder_ribbon::+1::muscle::fist:

[2018-08-29 20:04:21] <kilroyrobin> Thank you John, that’s right. This is proof of concept.

It’ll be up to all of us now to keep it.  
[2018-08-29 20:05:50] <fourdonks> The markets appear to think an outbreak of peace is a good thing, with the share price sharply up since word got out of agreement in Dublin and Italy - so in turn, I think management will be receptive going forward, with their eye keenly on the share price as usual.

[2018-08-29 21:01:13] <swfmcmanus> It's an Irish agreement, but sets a great level for the rest of Europe to follow. We can't negotiate or strike for all of Europe but by having a seniority number that is brought with you from base to base it will have to be implemented across the board over the next while. That's up to each country to sort out though.

[2018-08-29 23:24:29] <tomflood737> I see we have some Ryanair pilots who are members of UIL. I’ve opened a channel for you to discuss your issues etc.  
[2018-08-29 23:24:43] <jessica.emurphy2009> You have chickens you could send in photos of them 
[2018-08-29 23:36:02] <tomflood737> Hens, Jessica - chickens are for eating. You are right. There are a few in Dublin who keep hens for eggs. I used to grow rainbow trout in an Aquaponics system but because of this workload have now put Koi Carp in to reduce the workload. Plus the kids got attached to the trout, so catch and kill wasn’t fun.

[2018-08-30 10:01:08] <kilroyrobin> I am absolutely appalled by this action. Olav Leeman was one of the most valuable assets Ryanair had, they would see this clearly if only they actually had clear view of a future of cooperation as they claim to have. Instead we see here evidence of the blinkered view that shows a lot more of Ryanair’s past than its future. We have pushed the door and I’m proud to say it moved, but now we need to push it wide open and hook it back.

[2018-08-30 19:18:03] <ginosabatino> Serious question. Since slack was created, probably March time? Maybe Feb? We rapidly hit 1000 members, but have plateaued since then. In that time we have probably had about 300 new colleagues join us in ryanair and another 3000 exisiting colleagues still to sign up. 

How can we drive up membership, for communication is the key to unity.

[2018-08-30 20:24:27] <squaadgras> Rumours of this have been going ‘round for a while. Apparently his view dis not align with those of the company - and so was the pressure on him and his position unbareable. All rumours though.

[2018-09-01 11:27:05] <remco.spelt> Apperently you can exchange your old one for the new one, depending on ur base they might ask for original box/charger+cable (I hope about the original box is a joke)... No clue about delivery anyway  (edited)
[2018-09-01 13:16:58] <bkehoe00> These iPads will be a 5 year old model shortly...probably worth €50! Original cable must be a joke. :joy: No word of new iPads in my base anyway though I know they got handed out in DUB in May. Mine gets slower with every update.

122 Captains who already had month off

48% between 400- 500 hrs 
 (400-500hrs left for 6 months) 

32% between 500-600hrs
(leaving just 300-400hrs for 6 months)

90 First officers who already had month off:

58% had between 400- 500 hrs
 (400-500hrs left for 6 months) 

10% between 500-600hrs
(leaving just 300-400hrs for 6 months)

Conclusion for the 212 crew who had the month off already (most limiting) : 

80% of the captains will be very high on hours /out of hours during last few months 

68% of the first officers will be very high on hours /out of hours during last few months

I told her to compare the hours with the average jet2 guys fly per year (some 250-300 hours less per year) plus to forget about the ‘productivity bonus’. Think people will fall for these numbers??
[2018-09-01 15:10:26] <swfmcmanus> They have a wage benchmark now to use along with the rest of the CLA. Hopefully they've the sense to negotiate and vote that way.  
[2018-09-01 16:18:57] <coolhand787> Hello Remco thanks for this great feedback. Yes I look forward to the ending of the year. All my AD HOC AL has been denied till Nov 2018, and I had my month off already in Feb. today as an example I got a duty change at 0350 am and a colleague called on day 1! Of his month off. So RYR will be hard pressed to deliver the planned schedule. Thanks for the heads up!  
[2018-09-01 20:07:30] <danieltierney1> I really hope nobody pays for one of these. Pathetic stuff altogether! 
[2018-09-01 20:17:19] <tomflood737> They are worth Zero to them as they have already been written off against tax and will probably continue to do so even though they may have been sold off. 

This is sheer profiteering. The Ryaanair Twist as per the Rough Guide. 

I like the “pre loved” comment though, considering they may, if allowed want us to take the iPad to bed with us, in case of a change in duty. *If allowed*.  
[2018-09-01 21:01:26] <andy.airamerica> What does it say about how shit things have been for YEARS when a company can offer a 113% “pay rise” to a first officer. It’s not 113%. It’s giving back what’s been eroded over decades.

[2018-09-03 08:06:40] <damiano.detomassi> Not sure where to post this . I had a request from Ryanair lawyer working to fight off  cases of EU261 claims for an old ASR of mine for a diversion, she couldn’t search by crewcode as usual . This lead to an email exchange to find a solution and in this email I found out sometimes we as pilots need to appear at these hearings . Happened before and she said it’s quite common. Is this how is should be ? I never heard this before . We report facts and that is what is used in court I always knew (hence the ASR need to be true and not written later with old memories ) . This news about hearings with us appearing in court and being prepared by the Ryanair lawyer and thanks to us winning lots of cases is from today . Comments? 
[2018-09-03 08:13:03] <iglehane> I’ve had the same thing before. They wanted me to write a statement over one year after the diversion. I initially told them I couldn’t remember the flight which was the truth! I then received a letter to attend court in Hahn to give evidence. I emailed the RYR legal department with a copy and paste of my ASR. That seemed to fix the problem and no court appearance was required in the end. 
[2018-09-03 08:20:29] <kilroyrobin> I remember a few years ago a Captain from Dublin had to appear before judges in germany to explain a diversion. He did so and nothing more came of it I believe. 
[2018-09-03 08:41:37] <damiano.detomassi> Yes but imagine the number of claims in the past few months and she said “it happens frequently and we win cases thanks to pilots appearing in court “ . Is this a legal obligation for us to physically appear ? This can create lots of precedent and can of worms if personally responsible . Maybe a little paragraph on our negotiatiated CLA to avoid systematic use of pilots in hearing wouldn’t go amiss .

[2018-09-03 08:58:02] <ronan.walsh22> Not sure you could mitigate for that. If your called upon to appear in court I think you just have to show up and do it. Thankfully 99% of these things don’t get to that point and the CSR is sufficient. As to legal expenses or cost incurred I think there is something already about that, isn’t there? 
[2018-09-03 09:05:34] <damiano.detomassi> Called to court by who, the judge because your evidence is not sufficient (could have been mitigated by rewording ASR and some home work ) or Ryanair itself to have more weight at the court even without judge asking for it ? That is a big difference and expenses to get there sure but what about flight pay? What about side risks? You aren’t just a witness in that court case . Flew for many years never heard this before that is why I asked , due to the big amount of claims coming our way . (edited)
[2018-09-03 09:15:04] <ronan.walsh22> I think it’s the lawyers (or legal representatives) decisions on who needs to be there. A lot of time even if your called to court they might not use you. I agree it’s a massive inconvenience and worry for us but I don’t think ryr would ever put something down that they won’t use u if they need to. The compensation for loss of hours and time would be a better angle to go after I suspect. 
[2018-09-03 09:15:22] <jessica.emurphy2009> Ok will have to wait till I get to wifey  
[2018-09-03 09:16:25] <damiano.detomassi> Your opinion noted , and greatly appreciated ;-) 
[2018-09-03 09:25:16] <boswellbrown> I recently got asked by ryanair legal department for details of a flight that never went. Pax claimed technical. FR said ATC slot. Advised them we had a short slot but flight got cancelled due no engineer to attend a tech issue. Never heard a peep again. Suspect my feedback might have not been used. Remembered the flight well as one lady left in floods of tears as it was the third time in a week her flight had been cancelled! Not a good night at the office.  
[2018-09-03 09:32:40] <boswellbrown> :reminder_ribbon: 
[2018-09-03 09:34:24] <damiano.detomassi> Imagine if they start asking to appear , and we can’t refuse as they use the same “rough guide “ paragraph about unruly passengers that we must appear . Imagine we start avoiding cancellations by pushing limits harder / going into discrection when tired , landing when bad weather . Just not to appear in court . If this isn’t gonna effect safety as a chain effect then I don’t know what else .... 
[2018-09-03 09:40:55] <fergus.cassidy> You have to sync it first and then it works mostly. I fill them in the cruise and send as soon as I land. 
[2018-09-03 10:01:02] <kilroyrobin> *SO DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED?*

Everyone keeps asking me this, so did we? That depends who 'we' are. Did IALPA members in the R.O.I. get everything we asked for in our Ballot for industrial Action? *Yes*. We fought hard as hell and we got what we asked for, subject to Ballot and Board approval. (Going to be an interesting few days now).

*SO DID WE GET WHAT WE WANTED?*

Oh you mean *WE* the entire Ryanair Pilot body, *NO!!!*. Not nearly. The war rages on, we all fly the same planes in the same airline right across Europe, what happens anywhere effects everywhere. No one is sorted until we all are. When you ask what do we do next, you mean what do *we all* do next.

*SO NOW THATS OVER CAN WE GO AHEAD AND DO ‘THIS OR THAT' NOW?’*

You will have to answer that yourself now as a proven soldier in an Army of over 4000, not as one soldier in an Army of 100, and especially not as just one soldier. We tried just one soldier for far too long. If your next step is not a step taken in step with your Army then don’t take it. Simple.

*WHAT DID WE ACHIEVE IN 2018?*
:point_up_2:We achieved that. Proof of concept. Proof of the most proven concept in eternity. (edited)

[2018-09-03 11:31:28] <greggmcavan> Ryanair didn’t contribute a cent to the cost of my license 
I paid for it, I earned it. It’s mine

I don’t give a fuck what shitty emails memos phone calls or bullshit they spout

First line of their corporate mantra is “carry out our operations safely” its in Ops A

So that is what I’ll do be it weather, tech, hours limitations whatever the threat! and if any 2 bit middle manager wants to try to pressure to do otherwise then they’ll get a short sharp shock, I’m not loosing my license or going to jail for some faceless nark at the end of an email or some snotty arse twat on a phone 

The passengers will always get my sincerity, truthful honest apologies and I will always go out of my way to find out as much information to help them as possible and remain courteous to those that are “emotional” 
They are the reason we have a job and MOL gets to crow about his annual 1.4bn 

As the old adage goes

You think safety is expensive

[2018-09-03 12:51:41] <boston58730> Absolutely agree Greg but that is hard to do at STN. How do I tell pax that the reason we are waiting for (anything up to 2 hours so far) ground handling is that MOL doesn’t care about the level of service and once he has your money you are in a world of shit. By the way good luck with your complaints, the unsigned cheques are in the post.

These days I just unreservedly apologise, tell them I have called everybody I can and keep the door closed.  
[2018-09-03 12:58:22] <jessica.emurphy2009> If a cabin crew started home stby at 4am local then gets called off stby at 5am local for a 5am show what time does her duty start ??  
[2018-09-03 13:05:02] <sam.vanherzele> A colourful memo on a Monday? Ah, looks like it's been delayed by ATC or Vodafone as the date on top is last Friday.  
[2018-09-03 13:23:38] <noelintogher> As she was called within six hours of her standby start time and she was called before 0700 local time it just counts as a normal duty from check in time. Strange but true as far as I know.

[2018-09-03 14:52:15] <mischa_buijs> Time to ground airplanes again, we all know since september last year Ryanair does everything to improve on-time performance! 
[2018-09-03 15:10:52] <paul.mc.keown> I was in Hamburg last October as a witness for 2 hearing about a delay I had 18 months earlier because of a lightning strike. I was summoned by the judge and had to go. I was back again for a third hearing last month because the judge would not accept the testimony from the previous hearings. Ryanair were no help apart from releasing me from duties. I had to book and pay for the hotels and taxis myself and claim back from the courts which took about another month. As I was summoned I had to go. The legal department told me now that pilots get €290 for each day in court but you don’t get the payment for the days you spend deadheading there, only for the day you appear in court

[2018-09-03 15:57:19] <damiano.detomassi> As I said we need to code this as will become more and more an issue . In 6-18 months time we will get inundated by request from courts if the Ryanair lawyer is permitted to call us as testimony (I doubt the other part will need us ). So there is something we can do .

[2018-09-04 06:42:03] <tuhhodge> This is a good thread and as Damiano says, the issue of our delays, reports and EFL data regularly going into the realm of the courtroom is quickly approaching. Better start making better notes! With all this stress my memory of last week's flights is about as accurate as my memory of being in nappies....  
	:joy: damiano.detomassi, greggmcavan
[2018-09-04 09:30:45] <henry.stearn> Anyone had to do a "Quality Audit" in the sim and know if we get paid?  
[2018-09-04 09:52:52] <squaadgras> As duty? Would say standard sim payment of 187,50.. but not sure. 
[2018-09-04 10:26:58] <sam.vanherzele> Have a look what's on your roster:
0SIM means unpaid (ie your own sim). 
ISIM means paid but the amount depends on your contract. Instructors get paid whatever's in their contract. Heard before that contractors get the block time (but only rumour). No clue how much employees get. 
Anyway, make sure the roster says ISIM and not 0SIM.

[2018-09-04 15:53:41] <robwatts99> So now no matter what Christmas is an adhoc day :face_with_rolling_eyes: and as always they want you to plan all you years annual leave a year in advance. Why does it all have to be applied for in oct 18 for the year 2019? Don't they realise that just maybe when we get to April in the active year we may decide we want a block in August for example? Or that after a heavy spell of work we may need to take a block to recover. At least the adhoc system will be open year around but then if not applied for will be allocated or carried forward to the next year (I remember been told in the past when I had days due that that would not be possible) or put on off days. So now it's in writing they can put our leave on off days. But overall in fairness is a step in the right direction but just needs tweaks from our perspective.  (edited)
[2018-09-04 16:07:27] <remco.spelt> If this is their way of fairness.... 2 days per quarter must be planned, xmas is now suddenly mandatory ad hoc day, only 2 priority and if you have more bad luck, no option (as far as I can see) to take the month off for the ones who like to? Ridiculous time frames set to apply for it. And I could go on and on... 

What about an live/always open website (not using Ecrew fron ipad) where you can ask and see your annual leave and availability for your base? Why they make it so complicated..... (edited)
[2018-09-04 16:10:15] <oliver> Complete nonsense to me.

Its complicated, still no seniority based, as seniority will simply put you in a group or in another one and at rotation, next year you will be worse off than a new joiner.
In my book, when it is complicated, it is only so to make it confused and to hide some bullshit in it.

Again, we need the possibility to ask a certain amount of days on a last minute request, in order to cope with something that happened in our life or to simply recharge from a period of heavy work pattern.
I still dont see this apllied in here.

I believe they are not addressing the core of the problem (pilots leaving) and are simply trying to find a temporary fix by manouvering employee’s holidays. (edited)
[2018-09-04 16:14:18] <damiano.detomassi> Very simple, did he union negotiate this or come from the company? If from the company then we just don’t need to worry , it’s not gonna be good for us . 
	:point_up: masterharkin, remco.spelt, cianmurray, scotthemeryck, coolhand787
[2018-09-04 16:36:48] <robwatts99> That's exactly it. It's not possible to plan a years leave a year in advance. My misses works in airline industry too but won't be considering next years leave until next year so with our new system she will be trying to sync with me with takes away 50% of our flexibility. As I said the system has taken some correct steps. I just feel now it's needed to be adjusted by our councils to make a system that works based around this framework that gives us some flexibility.  
[2018-09-04 16:38:49] <damiano.detomassi> This comes from the company so it’s PRO company only. They didn’t give anything they don’t want to give . So it’s not even a base for a negotiation . It’s an example of what not to do, apart from the 5 blocks sure . That is cool . 
[2018-09-04 16:44:36] <robwatts99> Surely that's what negotiation is. That's their start point. We take what we like and bin the rest. The four blocks is good. The adhoc system open all year is good. Loosing a day to Christmas is bull:hankey: having to apply in 18 for all blocks in 19 is also bull:hankey: I can't figure out their seniority system (especially as so far no countries have have seniority). As I said if our councils get a hold of the good from this system and turn it to our benefit. Obviously as it is from our point it's not acceptable.  
[2018-09-04 16:47:53] <adamtruran> No union in Poland (yet) so no negotiations possible!

[2018-09-04 16:53:04] <carlhorgan2017> As usual lots and lots of clauses 
[2018-09-04 17:07:34] <damiano.detomassi> I say we select the way to select the wish . They said they discuss with pilots . Can we instead discuss it with pilots our way and even if we come out with the same thing we go from there ? Why 4 blocks ? We had 5 in 2008. Why so many clauses we don’t want . We need maybe a counter survey on what we like on annual leave and can’t be council work but RTPG as we all are on the same company roster .  
[2018-09-04 18:16:01] <sam.vanherzele> Apart from all other things that are wrong with this agreement, so far it’s only for the Polish pilots? 
[2018-09-04 18:17:10] <damiano.detomassi> Well yes it’s a shot across the bow , to see how we react . They cannot do this with unionized countries .  
[2018-09-04 18:21:01] <andy.airamerica> What the fuck am I doing wasting my time in a working group for annual leave if this shit just goes up on crewdock anyway. :rage::rage::rage::rage:

[2018-09-04 19:08:13] <adamtruran> 21. Q. Does this system apply to contractor Pilots?
A. Contractors do not have a leave entitlement, however, this new system will be used to grant periods of
unavailability

So this does not apply to around 95% of the Polish based guys??!! :thinking_face: :hankey: Worthwhile memo! 
[2018-09-04 19:14:27] <mtscuddy> Guys apologies if it's been asked before. 
I'm arriving at STN past 1am tonight due to delay and staying at the Novotel. Any idea if there is a staff bus going that way or cheap taxi company to get there? Hotel shuttle stops at 1am I believe. Thanks  
[2018-09-04 19:18:33] <adamtruran> I can only think of the taxi company that is situated as you walk out in arrivals. It’s not cheap to the Novotel as the taxi companies have to pay a surcharge on the Stansted Airport grounds. I reckon it’ll be about £10-15 
[2018-09-04 19:32:50] <mtscuddy> Thanks Adam, will have to do that I guess.  
[2018-09-04 19:58:02] <boston58730> Ask the crew if anyone happens to pass that way on their way home. I have dropped guys off, we’re not all bad guys at STN. You may get lucky.

[2018-09-05 12:48:18] <alex.was.oconnell> Great result. Although it would have been nice to see more of the contractor pilots exercising their rite to vote.

[2018-09-05 12:59:18] <brendancianmurphy> Great stuff! Agreed with Alex, would have been good to see more contractors voting.... interesting to know how many were eligible to vote altogether?  
[2018-09-05 13:11:51] <jfitzpatrick485> Do we know the number of contractors who voted? 
[2018-09-05 13:19:33] <henry.lidster> Well done :heavy_check_mark: 
[2018-09-05 13:34:40] <robertgormley53> In ref to Alex and John's comments, it would be interesting to know how many contractors based in Dublin are members of ialpa. Might not be that many, hence not many able to vote.  
[2018-09-05 13:36:02] <ginosabatino> Well done lads!! 

Out of interest, who is the longest serving pilot and is he on slack?!! 
[2018-09-05 13:40:46] <kev1kel> Great result. Looks like the lads who sit next to me wearing yellow lanyards and telling me how glad they are to finally be able to vote were telling me porkies.

[2018-09-05 13:47:01] <fergus.cassidy> As it was a secret vote there is no way of knowing who voted, either their contract type or rank. Some people were on holidays, some OOB.

100% is a brilliant result. Thank you to all who participated.

The IALPA office is a wooden cabin which arrived in fitting fashion from the U.S stuffed in the hold of a Jumbo. It is affectionately known by its members as “The Hut”. 

Visitors from abroad, who invariably have heard IALPA long before they ever saw it, are always surprised at just how small it actually is. 

Maybe my son Tom put it best today when he asked “Dad why is it so small on the outside but still so big on the inside?”

I don’t really know why exactly, but today of all days I know he is right. 100% right.

[2018-09-06 16:13:10] <johnfaessel> I don’t think there will any response! If I am not mistaken they have never recognized the RPTG as a negotiation partner, they must be terrorized of the RTPG since it means one block of UNITY against them. 
The fact that they have offered the UK and also lately Sepla a new pay deal, is because they don’t want to talk with the RTPG to avoid the CPP!

Highly effective. Disproportionately effective. It was probably only 18% if we really want to fiddle our realities here. In the pub when the story is told later it’ll be just ‘a handful’ though. Just a few good men and women. The story always gets better in the telling, though I doubt this one will need any polish. Fact is though it was a few good people in a handful of countries that achieved the un achievable. To those that marched with us and proved this can be done, you have your reward already. Self respect and pride. To those who will be with us in future, to bring this all the way home, know that now is the time to join the lions pride. We were all prey for far too long. Now we hold the line for our profession, for airmanship, for respect, for family, for our vocation, for working people everywhere, and for whoever walked beside you damn near more than anyone else. That’s a great feeling, the best around. Ryanair will never be the same now we have found that spirit. Those we march with are brothers and sisters now, in a way we could have never known before, and that I know is the feeling none of us will ever loose, even when the dust settles. Like all things, this too will pass, the fight will come to some order of balance or peace one day, just as it should, but whoever was in it will always know it. Come Hell or high water the pride will always be ours. Always!

[2018-09-08 04:22:43] <brendanjacobs> It’s unpaid in Ireland Pasquale. The law is not made for the working person here, it’s made to protect the employer. 
[2018-09-08 04:50:55] <justincharbon> In my case the Portuguese Social security covers the costs of weeks off. Ryanair just ‘clears your roster’. Where you pay your social that’s where the money should come from 
[2018-09-08 05:03:23] <brendanjacobs> What’s the length of time allowed for parental leave in Portugal?  
[2018-09-08 06:28:40] <justincharbon> I believe 21 or 25days in total officially.. more then the Irish give at least 
[2018-09-08 06:48:09] <aljaz.mezeg> In Italy you will get nothing as it should be part of the national labor agreement (CLA if you will) that we do not have... 
[2018-09-08 06:49:31] <aljaz.mezeg> Btw they will deduct your allowance as well for the amount of days you are on paternity. 
[2018-09-08 07:06:00] <brendanjacobs> So the amount of time off is based on Irish law but the amount of money you get is on Portuguese! You pay your social insurance in Portugal so you you should be entitled to all the benefits, not some sort of hybrid, Ryanair make it up as you go along sort of thing! The sooner everyone is on a local contract the better! 
[2018-09-08 09:52:47] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Reply which was posted in a WhatsApp group to a colleague asking “why not WOFF and take a bit of extra money”:

“
It’s a free world and I’m not dictating anybody what to do.

We, the company council members, sacrifice many, many off days working for our unity and terms and conditions. This is a long term fight, for even longer term benefits.
When we are not sacrificing off days we are giving up flights and sector pay. It costs ME money to fight for YOU (all).
I did not take the pay deal, so I’m even earning 12k less then the new joiners and upgrades (i know, they had no choice).
Other bases in Europe did not even have the 10k we got in STN, DUB, FRA and SXF.

Now, you might ask, “what does it matter if I take a bit of extra money”?
Fair question.
To give it to the CC?:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

The thing is, our movement can only succeed if Ryanair feels the NEED to change.
Without people leaving the company, without cancelled flights, without angry passengers, politicians, and most importantly: share holders, they will NOT change.

People leaving are taking our bad T&amp;Cs with them. Ryanair is infesting the whole industry. Competititor Airlines (:face_with_rolling_eyes:) need to lower their standard to be able to be competitive.

So in order to let Ryanair feel the need to change, they need to cancel flights.
For that, they need a lack of pilots.

And here you have it: for this, you need to not WOFF.

A bit of extra money now, is a lot less money in the rest of your whole career.

Let aside that we are not (principally) fighting for more money but for fair, legal, transparent, future proof conditions.

[2018-09-08 10:42:16] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Hi Pete, your message is by now old, but I still would like to reply.

Thanks for posting! 
Some people *might* consider people like you are breaking our ranks because of the queue jumping (which queue:thinking_face:). As a result, some of “you” might stay silent here.

I think the world is not so black and white. Yes, you’re jumping a non-existing queue, but given the chance I’d do the same and don’t blame you.
We all have different backgrounds and have suffered differently.

What is more important: you joined an union, joined Slack, and you speak your mind!
Your outside world view is really important, in order for us to avoid tunnel vision.

In the end though, we need to stop this influx and queue jumping. We can only do this with a well crafted CLA and MSL.
This will still benefit DEC and DEFO, since they have a transparent overview of their number on the list and estimated waiting times.

Please keep posting your views on Slack or directly to your union.
 
[2018-09-08 11:03:48] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Regarding the RAK example. The mediator failed to see that, MOL being the capitalist pur sang, it’s easy to get people to RAK: more :dollar:. 
Then again, that would be in contrast with our aim of getting “same work - same pay” principle (adjusted for cost of living).

Unity is across the channel! 
[2018-09-08 11:55:15] <damiano.detomassi> Even the adjusted for cost of living  in the euro zone doesn’t even look  fair . Cause then u will have bases like Porto or Greece where no one wants to go. Same work same net is more like it, adjusted gross for cost of taxes . (edited)

[2018-09-09 16:03:00] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> From the Cabin Crew Slack:

“I don't know if anyone knows the Iberia ground staff in OVD but many thanks to those who were on duty last night (especially Ruben and Katarina). We had to divert on the way back from FAO to LPL due to a medical emergency (heart attack), we were there for almost 2 hours, the airport was already closed and we had no drinks in the bar whatsoever (which really is getting to be a major issue). They've brought us 28 bottles of cold water that we could distribute among passengers and crew. It doesn't seem much but it was the very best they could do at that time. They have nothing to do with Ryanair as OVD is not even a destination anymore so hats off to them, great sportsmanship.

As a council member I am am very aware that some people have different views.
We should cherish those as well, otherwise we get tunnel vision.
As long as it does not get personal or abusive, that is...

I hope you will one day come back here and share your opinions, we need inputs from our members.

[2018-09-13 08:45:18] <masterharkin> SOCIAL DUMPING

Social dumping is a practice of employers to use cheaper labour than is usually available at their site of production or sale. In the latter case, migrant workers are employed; in the former, production is moved to a low-wage country or area. The company will thus save money and potentially increase its profit. Systemic criticism suggests that as a result, governments are tempted to enter a so-called social policy regime competition by reducing their labour and social standards to ease labour costs on enterprises and to retain business activity within their jurisdiction.

There is a controversy around whether social dumping takes advantage of an EU directive on internal markets, the Bolkestein directive.

Entities losing from social dumping:

Employees in exporting countries
Child labor in exporting countries
Industry and environment in exporting country
Government in exporting countries
Employees in importing countries
Shareholders of the company in importing countries

[2018-09-13 20:31:55] <adamtruran> Ryanair Management - Polish bases - WRO SUMMARY:

*13/09 meeting summary*

- Entire Poland to become under Ryanair Sun AOC. The plan is to separate the scheduled and charter operations. Schedule is all year, Charter is May-Oct. Those on charter deal will fly on the scheduled flights in winter.
- Winter 2018, 15 a/c and Summer 2019 is 23 a/c, all on SP- registration.
- pilots are to operate with Irish license, no polish Simulators are planned.
- ultimately Sun is to become its own entity, with a set of management in Poland. So it should be easier to get through to the head managers.. 

*contract* there's been a sample posted earlier, 3 year renewable, they guarantee 30h and that we'll operate mainly schedule with a portion of charter for operational requirement. There's no guarantee that 2018 won't be repeated (mix charter / schedule for everyone). They will not write into the contract a limit of how many GT or overnights per month. 
- PL tax and socials, Accountants are for each individual to decide who they want. There are no forced recommendations.
- All salaries paid in euros, on a Polish bank account. 
- Penalty clauses that we have all seen, they say, are on paper to avoid authorities to state that we are employees. The company promises not to charge any fees...
- OOB pay for schedule flights, but no hotels. *no OOB pay* for charter but hotels, per diems and GT are provided.
- if you get sick or A/L then the 30h pay doesn't apply.

*transition period*
- all SP- qualified pilots cannot operate EI-, and vice-versa. Which means no out of Poland bases flying. Aircraft will be registered SP- progressively with available pilots. 
- NOV+DEC they'd ideally like to have pilots transition to Polish AOC. Agreement is in process for "mini OCC" :
+ e-learning instead of ground school
+ SIM (RST?) for Sun AOC
+ Line Training = only LCK

*long term benefits*
- extra flexibility for shared roster 5/13 in winters, or 9 month per year work.
- Upgrades will be assigned internally in Sun, so Polish guaranteed bases

- if you decide in the future to want to return into DAC (Spain or Italy base for example), it could be a possibility but it does depend on what agreements are put in place with the unions in each State

[2018-09-14 09:58:54] <matthewwilson> I don't want to pour water on the flames but I actually received a phone call to ask how my diversion went (after a sector 4 diversion away from my home base). 

From a ground ops perspective. How long did taxis take to arrive? Were they okay? Did you have to pay for them (I said I don't pay for anything after not being reimbursed in the past)? Did the passengers have to wait too long? How could we improve things for you and the passengers?

I was shocked with the positivity of the call. But I did point out that I never pay for anything, I always get the handler to sort/pay for taxis etc (the guy had no problem with this). I also told him that next time I would be overnighting after a +12 hour day, rather than a near four hour taxi trip. Again, he had no problem.

[2018-09-14 10:06:16] <matthewwilson> Penalty clauses in contracts (for our Polish friends).

Does anyone else remember this?...

A good few years ago, when BRK were renewing contracts, they sneakily inserted a clause that made  crews financially responsible for all fines etc. Of cause, this was deemed unacceptable by us. We complained individually and the clause was removed (some people did not complain and kept the clause).

I'd say you could get the clause removed from the contract if you stick together. However, based on what I saw previously, you probably need to get the entire contract removed/replaced! 
[2018-09-14 10:15:40] <adamtruran> Further news from Poland base meetings in POZ and GDN: 

News from gdansk that the crew simply walked out of the meeting room after the presentation was given. No questions were asked, no hellos nothing. They all met 20 minutes before the meeting to discuss beforehand!

Regarding hotel, call OPS get them to immediately put you though to supervisor of CC and tell them hôtel will not let me leave if bill is not paid. So get another CPT/FO for XYZ flight!

[2018-09-15 19:14:43] <swfmcmanus> Possibly a letter with claims stating that you refused to operate a "simple xx sector day" and a benign roster and how you worked less than xx hours in the last 28 days, and how you enjoy 4 days off at the end of that week. How your claims are misleading to untruthful. Also baseless thrown in a few times and then some pro 5/4 commentary with some scientifically proven line weaved in there too.

It's the intimidation tactics we know and expect, but if the fatigue report is justified (with even a simple poor night's sleep) then there's nothing to worry about. You can have enough rest period but not be rested in that period. Make sure they don't cross that line.

My email is the ryrefb address and no text message options. They try to send you an email about a duty notification but it goes to my iPad so a phone call is all I accept.
A cabin crew in SNN got a phone call the other night at midnight about her flight vhang8ng the following morning yo a cadet training flight. She had to explain she wasn't a pilot. Penny is still dropping. 
[2018-09-18 08:39:42] <brendanjacobs> The NOK number on crewlink should be preceded by ‘999’ to prevent any ‘inadvertent’ calls being made to them. Whilst it is ridiculous and appalling behaviour to be calling next of kin in these circumstances, it is very important that we have a nok number on there, just in case the worst should happen. Don’t just remove it from the system. 
[2018-09-18 08:43:30] <brendanjacobs> Sorry it’s in the remarks that you put the 999. If they’re still getting calls and texts despite this then it needs to be reported to fops base manager. 
[2018-09-18 08:47:40] <fergus.cassidy> Unfortunately there are people in crewing who haven't been trained correctly or see no issue with this.

I told my nok contacts that if they get any communication regarding anything “other”  than an event that is obviously affecting my welfare .... such as a roster -duty change ... to then say the phone call is recorded and the company will hear from their solicitor for causing direct distress with potential health effects ....and also to feck off to offload that stress immediately :rage:

Thus comes back to the company ethos that we as crew are owned fully and must fully be available also when off duty ...... not !!!! They should stick to the contract of employment and plan things better from their side I.e get busy fixing their sh#t once and for all !!!!

Don’t remember the exact details, but it made slot of the news channels. He won 7k or something.

*Legacy Airlines - Legacy Airlines *

We hear this rhetoric quite regular with any or most correspondence from the current management minions. 

Does anyone know of any so called Legacy Airline that has produced a Billionaire CEO. 

and at what cost might I also ask. 

Legacy Airlines don’t have Billionaire CEOs because they provide their staff with a decent working environment, adequate pension assurance, and all that’s required for a sustainable future.

A sustainable employment model must be symbiotic and not parasitic.

People are wise in all different ways I suppose, but there is one type of wisdom which is powerful in this industrial relations game. Strategic wisdom.

I have two favourite strategists in all of this. Between them they have literally shifted our orbit from the dark side of the moon. 

One said to me the truest words yet spoken in this endeavour: “Beating Ryanair is easy, keeping Pilots together is the hard part!”

The other said “Dot on the wall - just keep going for the dot on the wall”. 

When you roll those two up in Rizla+ there’s only one thing left to do.

[2018-09-20 13:41:48] <brendanjacobs> Don’t know if any specific number of no shows that can lead to dismissal. They do however consider ‘absence from work resulting in abandonment of duties’ as being gross misconduct. Technically they can go straight to firing you for just one! They’d find it very hard to convince a judge that dismissing someone for one absence to be fair and reasonable though.  
[2018-09-20 13:52:50] <damiano.detomassi> Source for what he says is the article , source for the 300 million is easy math of the EERC last year , when bellew came in they said their expenses will grow by 100million for staff , now is 200. We at that time joked as 300 million would give us all 2x salary .  
[2018-09-20 17:44:07] <damiano.detomassi> But in Ireland I believe they aren’t forced to re hire a unfairly dismissed employee right ? That is what some colleagues fear , court case and money but still unemployed .

Crew are living down here in ZAD and having to choose between a transfer to LTN or take unpaid leave this winter. 
Most are taking unpaid having had the intention of returning to ZAD next summer, but this week looks likely they are closing the base for summer as the flights next year are coming from other destinations. 

Of course no news for crew, and unfortunately will be a big impact for quite a few of them with their lives here. (edited)

[2018-09-23 07:18:41] <remco.spelt> Ryanair cabin crew unions from five countries have announced joint Europe-wide strike action to take place next week Friday, 28 September, to be staged by workers from Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Italy and Spain.

From an newsarticle 1 day ago... Germany has an meet g the 25th and possibly the pilots in Italy will join the strike according another article. Poland will be ready to strike next year (as mentioned here on slack) and other countries might join last moment (like Germany, Sweden)... Will be 24hr strike, from 00 till 00.

Spainish union has reported to government the strike date, Belgium union is gonna strike for sure, rest I can't tell.... Although Ryanair thinks like last time it will have a small effect (600+ in 2 days... biggest amount of cancellations which was in Italy I believe)

[2018-09-23 09:37:28] <oliver> Bob, if you go on the base channels, there are various days (10 in Italy) programmed to give insights about the strike. In MXP on the 24, in BGY on the 27.

About noshows, from your previous comment, I can only say that RYR is not shy in giving them. Few years ago during the volcanic ash european airspace closing, while I was on my days off at home, I was unable to reach CAG and ended up arriving there on my first day (standby) by boat and scooter. Base captain and crew control knew I was not able to work and that I did everything humanly possible to be there..... yet they still gave me a noshow and deducted pay from my salary.

I do really hope people will join the strike and make it worth the effort that so many pilots, cabin crews and unions put into organizing it. 
[2018-09-23 10:22:25] <pilot> I understand, but I need to know before the 27th as i will not get out of my base at all.  
[2018-09-23 10:38:14] <kilroyrobin> I find this occurrence absolutely bazaar.  
[2018-09-23 10:41:54] <kilroyrobin> Not only Bazaar but it seems to cast a weird shadow over the proud day for father and sun it seeks to promote. Seems to illustrate the  disconnect it is supposed to mask more than anything. Of course it could just be some random IT mistake - of course.  
[2018-09-23 22:35:09] <tyronebloem> Guys! I remember there was a memo about diversions. Incase of diversion don’t inform pax before departure?! Anybody has the memo or know where to find it?

The one time we knew that we had to divert before we left half of the passengers already knew and weren't too pleased when the captain initially told them we'd still go to the destination and then later be told that we'd have to divert. No. 1 told us it was the most hostile flight he'd ever had.

[2018-09-24 16:26:23] <padawa> In all seriousness tho, this could be a possibility??? What’s to stop them trying?! This may be their way of combatting the seniority thing and dividing us all again, have a new AOC for every country and have them as separate companies! Sounds dramatic but this is Ryanair and why the hell else have they done this Polish stunt?? i.e Ryanair Sun?! Even more reason to join up, we need another recruitment drive for BALPA!! (edited)

[2018-09-24 19:14:41] <coolhand787> Well Jessica the financial pressure will decide on MOL’s fate. Our pressure will certainly remind investors that MOL and Bonderman are not the appropriate top brass any more and CEO’s can get their head chopped off any day. Especially in this strike situation where RYR are not showing much good will. I remind you where we are coming from. In 2007 a SFO in HHN had a basic salary of 45k€ and sector checks of 2500-3000€. Captains was 81k€ and similar sector checks. Look where we are now and this was without any extras m. So the mountain to climb with CLA and T&amp;C improvements is still very steep. In any case I am looking forward to my 200k€ annual salary and the SFO’s around 120k€... 
[2018-09-24 20:00:53] <jessica.emurphy2009> Yes Andre I agree I used to be on the old old contract, I was referring to the share price and how low it will go before the blind will see the light, I too look foreword to getting back to my old salary

[2018-09-24 23:11:26] <hrvojesucic> Would anyone of you gentlemen (and ladies) know anything about Ryanair getting rid of summer bases? I’m in ZAD until the end of summer season and if we take a look on the S19 schedule the rotations are completely opposite (unlike the previous 3 years here).

[2018-09-25 06:50:38] <tyronebloem> What I heart the summer bases are not coming back anymore! 
[2018-09-25 07:00:39] <boston58730> Can somebody copy or post a link to the EASA regulation which states that the operator must organise and pay for transport to/from hotel accommodation. I would like to reference it in a query. 
[2018-09-25 07:38:46] <brendanjacobs> I could be wrong but I don’t think there is one. The only thing it says is IF they want to use min rest away from home base as 10hrs then it must be provided. That would be Ryanair’s response I suspect. Someone else might know better though! 
[2018-09-25 07:39:18] <damiano.detomassi> There was an answer from easa to a query just like that , posted on slack . 
[2018-09-25 08:32:23] <boston58730> Thank you guys. Foiled again. Do you reckon I can claim back a Global 5000 transfer to Luton? Maybe I can get them a discount by asking Damiano if he will fly it. 
[2018-09-25 08:44:16] <jonguz> This is what EASA answered some time ago:

Here is an email from EASA covering Ryanair responsibilities as an operator (Ryanair contracts and contractors):
"Dear ...,
 
For the purpose of ‘rest away from home base’ , we understand that the operator has to provide  ‘suitable accommodation’ to the crew members. In other words, the operator has to do what is necessary to discharge this responsibility e.g. find and book a suitable hotel accommodation, pay for it and  exercise control over the quality of the accommodation and if it continues to comply with the established standards for ‘suitable’.
 
This is because, during rotations the operator must exercise control of the whole operation - from the departure from home base to the arrival  at home base at the end of the rotation. The term control contains lots of elements, one of which is that the operator has to ensure that crew members will have adequate rest away from home base to continue the rotation as planned. It also includes, control of the post- and pre-flight times, ground transportation to/from the hotel, standby, nutrition etc.
 
The operator may delegate some or all of its duties and responsibilities, but the ultimate accountability rests with the operator. This means that the operator has to verify the initial compliance with the applicable standard of any contractor as well as its continuing compliance. Simply paying to a contractor for its services does not mean that the operator fulfils its duties.

[2018-09-25 08:52:27] <damiano.detomassi> Only BBJ for me sorry , but global is nice!! But let’s pay attention to what she means by “rotation “. Ryanair doesn’t have “rotations” per se , apart from the Ad Hoc charter session. The whole crew is never sent to overnight around as scheduled , they just put people on other bases so they always try to treat it as temporary out of base flying . Of course definition of rotation is when FDP and Rest happens away from home base , but the way they plan it is emergency single crew member stop gap. EasyJet for examples has official  rotations , so does Norwegian . Ryanair will need to start getting proper planning of rotations in with standard hotac and transports if need to continue with this madness . (edited)
[2018-09-25 09:11:10] <boston58730> @jonguz Jon do you happen to have the email address for Irina Petrova. I will send her an example of an OOB roster with DH and ask for clarification if that counts as a rotation.

[2018-09-25 22:11:04] <kilroyrobin> *People always ask, why the Unicorns:unicorn_face::unicorn_face:?* well I suppose it’s for family, and for family values. Like so many other things it started with a post on WhatsApp. This one was posted by @healyglen, now a father of 4, and definitely one of the suspects in the lineup for who fathered all the unity around here too. Most of us in the heart of all this are in fact family men trying to live up to the standards we would expect of our own children, and that - believe it or not - ain’t always easy. This post appeared around the build up to action in December and it is from this post that the :unicorn_face: emoji was born into our fight as a symbol of why we bother. Pilots have families, they are not just aircraft parts, and lest we forget by the way, so does every other soul onboard. The post read:-                       *”For the first time in over 12 years I've felt pride in wearing the uniform since the Dublin pilots confirmed strike action. How could anyone be expected to take pride in the uniform of a company that doesn't take pride in itself? I felt pride because fellow professionals going through security already interact with us differently now because we will be taking a brave step on the 20th which will benefit pilots all over the world in the long term. My 6 year old is here as I text and she is one of the 3 (plus one in the oven!) main reasons that I'm 100% confident that this is the right thing to do, irrespective of its outcome. I have always taught them to stand up to bullys. Stand tall Italia! She also asked me to "put up a unicorn instead of the angry fist thing"* :unicorn_face: :unicorn_face: :unicorn_face: (edited)

[2018-09-26 01:39:33] <dohpau> The WhatsApp message "Put up a unicorn instead of the angry fist thing" will be a moment that I will always remember, it showed that this fight is not about revenge but about what we deserve.
We deserve contracts that prevent against the tax man knocking at your door, against phonecalls in your rest period, against contracts that can't secure a mortgage, against contracts that "competitor airlines" wouldn't accept.
I want *fair* conditions, I want respect. The unicorn is my symbol of that, I hope it is also yours.

[2018-09-28 07:39:11] <jessica.emurphy2009> What does OFFSTM mean on the roster pattern?? 
[2018-09-28 07:39:34] <ginosabatino> I think that is a code for annual leave for a contractor  
[2018-09-28 07:50:08] <tyronebloem> What Gina said is right! 
[2018-09-28 08:12:46] <adamtruran> Correct  
[2018-09-28 08:17:06] <jessica.emurphy2009> 1 I’m Ryanair 2 didn’t apply for it 3 makes no sense 
[2018-09-28 08:26:49] <brendanjacobs> Probably the usual crewcode typo. Send a query and should be fine. Unless they’re trying to assign A/L to off days again! 
[2018-09-28 08:29:00] <jessica.emurphy2009> It’s my day two for this Sunday tried to call crewing but wasn’t even able to get connected must be Vodaphone fault 
[2018-09-28 09:08:51] <fergus.cassidy> They upgraded vodafone last night. Needed a new excuse. How's your hour limits. Mines just crossed the 100 planned by 3 minutes next week as I was late by 3 minutes last night. Cutting to the bone and beyond. 
[2018-09-28 09:28:22] <jessica.emurphy2009> I haven’t looked but had two A/L days last week so don’t think I’m that high  
[2018-09-28 10:30:09] <mark_gilmour99> I think the STM means scheduled for Termination due Militancy (only joking Jessica :joy: )

The NTSB and NASA deny any link to it so do we have an actual study?

[2018-09-28 15:59:07] <boswellbrown> As far as I’m aware the company and original author have never put the research / data / methodology up for independent verification. I was party to a conversation about this years back. This very question was raised by Gerry Conway. Present were myself, GC, David Swarbrick and a TRE who’d probably prefer his name not be mentioned. No one had a clue.
The IAA May have looked at results but... perhaps we’ll leave their input out of this, fag packets comes to mind.... just like the 45 min check in. As you’ll recall it was all NASA approved, so nothing to see here... move along, no wait, actually turns out NASA had nothing to do with it!

[2018-09-29 02:42:02] <swfmcmanus> SBY calls should have an increased time to accommodate this as well. I spoke to a crew member in GLA recently who said a lot of people are transferring to EDI and the company wouldn't give them the extra 30 mins to get to EDI on the bus.

[2018-09-29 05:37:22] <spac> Until the pilot unions get together with the cabin crew unions, to cause a network-wide stoppage, one day strikes will not have the desired effect.
We all understand the pain the company causes is crews (maybe office staff are as equally badly treated?). An additional 3 hours of travel time, just "because", is going to cause misery for all concerned, not just those having to do it, but their families, too.

[2018-10-01 07:27:37] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> The closure is inhumane in itself. 5 weeks notice is a record low:cry::triumph:

Full sympathy to all involved. 
[2018-10-01 07:47:22] <derekfdoyle> This has been going on since the beginning of the year. (Ex) Customers have been complaining on social media of emails from Ryanair informing them that their flights will not be going ahead.  We have no way of knowing how many of these secret cancellations have taken place.

[2018-10-01 07:54:02] <chrisvanroyen> I expected them to reduce, but closing the base entirely seemed foolish. EIN base is running really well. They make a lot of money there!
By closing EIN they have 1 union less to deal with. They lost 2 courtcases from VNV. One of them regarding competitor pilots. They were told by the judge that Ryr cannot decide who’s at the table!

[2018-10-01 07:59:08] <jeremie.jacquand> This is a great chess move for Ryanair...puts pressure on the guys thinking twice about signing the Sun deal and could minimise future disruption from ongoing strikes from crew in small bases ?

[2018-10-01 08:10:50] <iglehane> It’s interesting how they only realised all these “problems” after the AGM:face_with_rolling_eyes::hankey: 
[2018-10-01 08:14:58] <remco.spelt> It is really sickening that they attack small base like BRE and just close EIN instead of showing they are really willing to negociate (nomatter who is at the table). But we pilots knew already they are not serious but they are hiding behind profit warning and fuel costs... Disgusting.... I really hope that they gonna turn back the decision. 

If we let this happen who knows what they do next.... We must take action now. All of us must come up with something to do. I agree with many others for European strikes until management quits, but we should keep thinking of other possibilities....

[2018-10-01 09:24:32] <boswellbrown> What’s interesting too is that in press its said they plan to fly most routes by reverse rotation? So it is easy to assume it’s not a capacity cut. Perhaps heading to the court to prove this is punitive is worth more than a punt! Try and get courts to block the rotation reversals. Drag the airports into it too by claiming they’re complicit in undermining rights. You can’t claim it’s not viable and still fly them. This is an attempt to punish dissent.

[2018-10-01 11:46:04] <ledwithcolin> I notice that for the full winter season the EIN DUB flight switches to a Dub aircraft and the timings allow for a W pattern.  So capacity at ein may not drop that much if replicated around the network.  Definitely stinks of bully tactics. 
[2018-10-01 11:59:14] <thomas> That was exactly what I was thinking Colin. It comes across as blatant bullying or a tactic to force the unions in a certain direction, not unlike the 3 months notice BS in Dublin.

I can remember a memo about bullying in the work place during the strikes and that it has to be reported etc. How come an employer is being allowed to do this without any repercussions? 

I do think something has to be done on a political level like Jessica says. Maybe all the unions can now find a way to do something on a grander scheme together.

I feel fortunate having colleagues like you all who stand up for what's right and who are trying to make a difference. Thank you.

Until they walk in HQ on a Monday morning and see ops with their head in their hands saying “it’s all on the ground, nowt has left”, and then spent a couple of days ringing everyone from pilots to union heads and being told “but you’ve negotiated and signed xyz with “your people and their unions” what’s your problem”

And left like that for a few days to show how serious we all are

Else this airline will never ever ever change 

It’ll just get worse

[2018-10-01 22:17:59] <boston58730> I think it’s a bluff on their part. I know it’s easy for me to say but I think if they had enough guys signed up they wouldn’t make such a fuss about it. For direct entry I can’t imagine anyone other then low hour cadets and utter rejects with a couple of hull losses under their belt signing that shit and even then, why not just sign up for McGinly.

[2018-10-02 08:40:00] <rvelthove> I'd say either one of these if we want to stop the downward spiral:
start an eu wide strike, and let them make the decision when it will end.
Or:
This week 1 day, next week 2 days, week after three days etc..

I so much wanted to devote myself to make this company the best in the world for its employees and the company itself, and I still do, but it is clear that it takes two to tango and the leaders will accept nothing less than total control regardless of the consequences.

[2018-10-02 12:51:26] <alex_hemming> The 10% employer contribution to the pension is the winner at jet2, compared to this place. If you do 25years as a captain at Ryanair you walk away with around 405k in the pot. Assuming 3% interest on investment, based in Portugal, you putting 6% and company putting their current contribution (6k without addendum signed).

Now compare that to 25years at J2, the same 3% and 6% assumptions. It's £832k. Considerably over double. (edited)

[2018-10-02 13:11:26] <coolhand787> On a more serious note, RYR has singled out the stronghold bases where unity is very high and which are strategic to RYR’s money making model. Plus as the union busting continues, I would be curious how many are UIL affiliates rather than ANPAC which was ‘pro RYR’  
[2018-10-02 13:13:36] <coolhand787> are based in PSA. RYR does not do anything by chance. They are still fighting the unions not cooperating! Still old ideology of trying to hold onto controlling the situation! RYR has lost control and the share price drop is a clear signal that MOL and co have completely lost their touch! Too much greed leads to their downfall. Like Ikarus flying too close to the Sun!

I record it, for myself as a recollection, and only once I had to use it, when someone in operation said it was not true they promised (such and such.....)  I told them I had a recording of his promise.... he changed immediately his attitude upon hearing the recording. 
Even if it is not legally binding its hard to say its untrue after listening to himself promising it. (edited)

[2018-10-03 07:14:58] <oliver> EUROPE FINALLY STARTS WORKING ON RYANAIR, MINISTER RELEASES STATEMENT
FNV Aviation is happy that the Netherlands are joining an alliance of five EU countries who want to force Ryanair to conform to national law. 
“Ryanair personnel should be treated according to the laws of the country where they are stationed.” According to Minister van Nieuwenhuizen of the ministry of Infrastructure. 
“This is good news” says Leen van der List of FNV Aviation. “This is the first time the minister has made an explicit statement like this. This is a victory for the workers and the unions in Europe who have been fighting for this for a long time.”
The alliance has asked the European Committee to establish clear guidelines so member countries can start implementing them. 
If Ryanair closes their ‘home base’ in Eindhoven, flights will still arrive and depart, but Ryanair can hide from Dutch labor law. Ryanair can use personnel stationed in, for example, Ireland or Romania. When more countries join the alliance, it will become more and more difficult for Ryanair to find and abuse the loopholes in EU law.
Van der List: ‘If the closing of the base is cancelled, or if Ryanair decides to reopen the base in Eindhoven in 6 months, we can immediately claim good working conditions based on Dutch labor law. It would be good to see this alliance grow and see countries from Southern and Eastern Europe join.”

I would not jump to quick conclusions, especially now when the government is really helping us out. Uil is working very tightly with government.

I would suggest you asking your union to join the task force and work with the government, instead of having them continuosly putting obstacles in allowing real changes for our future.

[2018-10-03 21:33:05] <oliver> Well today the italian judge has ruled about the Anpac agreement and has confirmed that art.32 is definitely illegal.... freedom of union choice must be allowed and agreements prohibiting strike actions as signed by Anpac are illegal. 
[2018-10-03 21:45:59] <damiano.detomassi> So what implication does it have , in practice ? 
[2018-10-03 22:12:15] <oliver> First thing is that for example all monetary reduction applied to people on strike and all noshows must be removed and reimboursed.
There must clearly no penalty in career advancement, rosters etc to striking crews.
The agreement signed by Anpac for pilots and proposed to the cabin crews, must remove completely all mention to termination and review of agreement, including the no strike clause inserted in the agreement itself.
Now a judge has ruled, its not just common sense, RYR must abide. 
[2018-10-03 22:14:30] <damiano.detomassi> Final ruling or can be appealed ? 
[2018-10-03 22:47:18] <oliver> <#CCK6095RC|ma_uil>

Today the italian judge ruled in favour to us:
No more no shows during strike
No more monetary deductions during strikes.
Removal of any rule prohibiting strikes, as inserted and accepted by Anpacs agreement.

[2018-10-04 09:50:08] <damiano.detomassi> This is a copy paste (different airlines) from a memo from PB (his signature style ) from 2009. Lots of small airlines went down that year due to the global financial crisis and they use that as propaganda to make us sign the deal that brought down our T&amp;C to what we have now. We lost sim hotel . Sim on on day . Sim rental car and food , 2 sims every 6 months . -15% pay , annual leave month off system introduced ....this guys never change , these are the sick minds we have in management . 
[2018-10-04 11:07:11] <matthewwilson> Pension is arguably the most important part of our salary but no one realises until they retire! Virgin offer up to 25% matched salary. We should be aiming for a deal more like this.

[2018-10-04 11:08:32] <matthewwilson> Can you let us know what happens so we get a "heads-up" before he comes to Porto? 
[2018-10-04 11:29:58] <sikokr> Hi folks, I have to go to DUB with my wife next friday but the ticket now is 
2,120.12PLN ~~500€ return :man-facepalming: 
 Would anyone have a spare blue ticket I am happy to pay 100€. Cheers :+1:  
[2018-10-04 11:48:26] <oliver> Sure will 
[2018-10-04 11:59:48] <owencomiskey> Hi Chris, I have some blue tickets left, you can have one ( free of charge of course) :+1: 
[2018-10-04 12:59:29] <hrvojesucic> The thing is, Damiano, that people that have joined RYR from e.g. 2012 onwards have no clue as to how it was before. That includes me (joined in 2015), and I have no choice but to rely on captains’ willingness to spread the word about how RYR unilaterally reduced the T&amp;Cs. I understand that the captains hardly have any willingness to discuss anything because you’re always flying with new guys, but it’s vital that you do exactly that :muscle::skin-tone-2::male-pilot: 
[2018-10-04 13:24:04] <boston58730> It’s so hard to do that without spending the whole day moaning. Apart from less to do flight prep wise due to EFB, absolutely everything is worse. So I just talk about the weather. 
[2018-10-04 14:14:33] <hrvojesucic> That’s true. It’s not easy, and I know it’s impossible to do it every single day (to moan, as you said Serks), but if you stumble upon a guy that thinks this is “super”, make sure you do some fact checking :+1::skin-tone-2::wink: 
[2018-10-04 16:43:38] <damiano.detomassi> I will never get tired until I get tired . You will notice the difference ;-) 
[2018-10-04 17:48:20] <alex.was.oconnell> If you listened to all the doom and gloom from PB about how bleak the future of the airline industry is looking you’d be inclined to consider changing professions altogether.  
[2018-10-04 19:36:50] <robwatts99> Any work on the meeting? 
[2018-10-04 21:02:30] <fergus.cassidy> Maybe management should get into a more positive work environment career. I hear both North Korea and Russia are recruiting.
How things would change. Check in has now got longer. Along with Check in in to crewdock, you check in to netline to get a voyage report, you then check in to lido, you then log on EFL and download each plan for all sectors separately, then you need to find a way to recover from all the feckin checking in, FCI Friday, it'll like check in Tuesday every day.
Moan over. Back to my 12 hour easy day tomorrow.

[2018-10-05 02:16:11] <oliver> I have just landed 4am, 
an easy two sectors, than got two more sector added.

Tomorrow I will know more. (edited)
[2018-10-05 03:31:23] <oliver> From what a cabin crew told me it seems they are pushing a new agreement onto them and have explained that base closures or reduction is because of higher costs and less pax caused by the strike.

Here it is what she said went on at the meeting:

“He made a sad speech about the fall in profits, due to the price of fuel and of course becsuse of the consequences of the strikes, causing  a decline in bookings.
As a result, if profits do not go up again, then they will have to review the costs of some bases in order to maintain current incomes.
He than presented some parts of the new contract agreement and explained that for the cabin crews, it is still in negotiations, he than confirmed that, for now it will simply be an 'agreement that will complement the Irish contract ... 
by the end of 2019 they will bring a  real Italian contract.
The agreement will be voted only by members of trade unions Anpac/Anpav and CISL, afterwards it will be shown to everbody.
 Everyone can than choose whether to accept it or not ... the Italian contract, will instead be offered to all... and will terminate the irish contracts.
RYR does not want to accept UIL union for two reasons:
1. do not want to take part in the personal table of other competing companies.... 
 2.as long as they can, they will not open negotiations with anyone else ... in Italy there are too many and do not want to have to deal with many unions.
As soon as the agreement is voted on, they will go around the bases to explain it in detail.
Afterwards, there will be specific people, to contact in each region, for everything related to required information, bureaucracy, health care, etc. ... “. (edited)

[2018-10-05 09:27:54] <boston58730> Excuse the sarcasm. A lot of airlines are doing this now where they advertise the job without telling you the most important thing. 

It would be like us going through the whole selection process and then at the end letting them know you only wanted the job during your month off at FR. 
[2018-10-05 09:28:51] <spac> No problem, and I totally understand your sentiment.
Professional pilots are being shafted all over the world. 
[2018-10-05 09:32:10] <boston58730> Went to the trouble of filling out the application form of one airline before they got back to me with the ‘deal’ and was annoyed that I had bothered to waste my time.

I imagine if it was a good deal they wouldn’t be ashamed to publish it. Will probably go along to the open day because I am off anyway. Will post the pay on here if they tell me.

[2018-10-05 10:32:02] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Many VPN providers, especially the paid ones, have many IP addresses available. Mine for instance has about a 100, and roughly have of them are indicated as being suitable for peer-to-peer (not your use case, but still).

If your IP addresses are blocked I would inform your VPN provider, most likely they can offer you alternative addresses.
If not, cancel the contract.

If memory serves right in Ireland only one party needs to know about the recording, and all calls from DUB HQ are recorded by RYR anyway.

[2018-10-07 05:47:45] <brendanjacobs> I see BA have opened up recruitment for FO’s again. How does FR honestly think they can compete with the likes of companies like this?! They still have not acknowledged the problem, they have a crew retention and recruitment problem. As long as proper airlines are continuing to hire, Ryanair doesn’t have a hope of achieving its ambitious growth plans. Not when the refuse to change. It is a shame the shareholders didn’t take their opportunity at the AGM. There’s only one way to fix this, and it involves all of us! Tick tock

[2018-10-07 06:01:22] <castillayasser> TAP announced that is looking for 300 pilots in Spain. A320TR would be considered but is not a requirement some as Portuguese, only if you want to upgrade which takes about 6 years. Now they have 1.200 pilots and they’re planning to have 1.800 by 2025. I think few FR pilots may be interested on. TAP knows most of them will come from LowCost airlines as they offer better conditions. 
[2018-10-07 06:57:25] <spac> I've just watched the MMA fight between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov. The Irishman was as common as muck with a mouth to boot. The Dagestani was, until after the end of the fight, quiet, and composed. Slowly, and inexorably, the Irishman was controlled and finally squashed. The fight was over with a surrender.
I see a similar situation where a particular Irishman has to be equally controlled, until he is removed from the company, along with his cohorts.
The company, wealthy though it is, will founder and fail, unless something is done about the crass way it is being run by people too stupid to be able to change.

[2018-10-07 08:54:33] <remco.spelt> 2 days ago on the flight plan (Málaga) AGP - AMS (Amsterdam)... Only 2 alternates listed, HHN (planned) and CPH. Called flight planning to see if there was any reason, EIN, Bru, NRN, CRL were not listed and they did not know. They called me back 10 min later saying lido couldn't find a route to those alternates and were therefore not included. Moreover they told me in case of diversion I could only use HHN (C4) or CPH (C8) , unless they would send a new flight plan delaying the flight. Weather was almost cavok and I decided to go with the flight plan I had... Meaning only HHN as alternate as others I could not use and CPH was like 1 ton extra. You guys think this is normal? Never had it like this before. Can't imagine that the company wants me to go to HHN in a situation like this and of course we as pilots would be blamed....:thinking_face: (edited)
[2018-10-07 08:59:13] <kilroyrobin> I believe the reason the Irish employees of Ryanair have fought among the hardest in our struggle is that all of us do not accept our management or their band of thugs with this very particular brand of social vandalism as ambassadors of our Irish way of life. Neither do we accept our capitulating slaves of commerce who call themselves government. *We the upstanding employees who take a stand are the ambassadors of our Irish life*, not the bullies and thieves we rise against.

[2018-10-07 09:05:15] <bkehoe00> Probably not related but the way they use LIDO is quite restricted and there's a good few new guys in flight planning that don't know why certain things are done the way they are. Its locked down to only get to choose between routes defined in advance between airports when automatically generating the FPL (i.e. something that would be ideal should we use Company Routes in the FMC). So if someone has only programmed it with one or two routes between an airport pair then it'll quite happily plan a flight straight through the 150kt headwind when another route is available that could avoid the headwind. If they manually generate a flight plan then they can allow it to dynamically choose a route.

[2018-10-07 09:13:57] <robertwasilewski> Well indeed LIDL is restrictive but still just a flight plan to fulfil legal requirements...once airborne you can take any suitable (for you) alternate, and no one can blame you anything as far as it's safe... (edited)

[2018-10-07 09:19:01] <boston58730> From memory the manuals state that if a diversion is likely then you should make sure the FPL has enough fuel for holding and then diverting to C1. On this occasion they fobbed you off because of the CAVOK. If diversion is unlikely they always try to use an alternate which results in minimum fuel uplift.

You are allowed the strike out the planned alternate fuel and put in fuel for C1. If C1 isn’t listed I usually use the highest alternate fuel figure. In case of Greece alternate can be very far in which case I just plan to arrive at dest with 4 or 5 tons.

So long as you have a reason for what you do, you can do it. If BC tries to second guess your fuel decision it will be over the phone. Don’t argue just ask for it in writing. It will never come. They have all been told not to push us on fuel decisions and especially not in writing.

Hopefully the EU under pressure from friends in the Dáil Lower house in Ireland can effect legislation / a ruling to say if you work for the same company across the EU then you can unite for at least one common condition of employment  . Therein lies the protection for coordinated cross EU action . The bullies’ tactics go against the freedom of movement of workers across the EU . This is to choose and be protected where to live and work without being loaded on a truck metaphorically and shifted out as punishment..particularly when there is no Solid financial reason for a company to do so .... this has to stop . Is Mol trying to be like Elon Musk and drive it into the ground and show off with the company management clout . You could imagine the boardroom ... “Look what I can do as I won’t be told what to do , so f#ck them ... so there !!! “ .
Robin , we stand by you all the way :muscle:. You nailed it in the head. The Independents should call out louder this Autumn the sneaky sleazy backroom relations between large companies mngt and the so called government. After all , these companies are bonus paying retirement homes for incumbent f#ckers with other people’s money couldn’t even run a post office !!! Sounds familiar as we the staff are paying for the continued mistakes by mngt . Time to lay down tools ? A week should do it ?  (edited)
[2018-10-07 10:45:48] <remco.spelt> Thanks for the tips and advice guys :+1: 

To avoid any doubt they did not fobbed me, I told them diversion would be very unlikely wx wise but wanted to know if AMS suddenly would close (atc failure, radar failure etc) 

The thing is that they told me on the phone with that flight plan I was expected to go to HHN (lowest listed commercial alternate) or delay the flight (which I would definitely do when the wx is not CAVOK) to be able to use the other commercial alternates which were not listed and I had no wx/notams from them (opening times, wip etc) 

Of course I know in flight you can use any alternate, as we as commanders have the final authority to do whatever we seem necessary for the interest of safety.

As for lido and use/listing of commercial alternates I already sended once a query and response was that is how lido works and unless you request specific commercial alternates to be listed it will choose the optimal ones. However I can't see how diverting from AMS to HHN or CPH would be economical/logical with so many airports closer by, but hey Ryanair and lido logic. They are to understaffed to check the logic reasoning of LIDO and to manually put in a logic FPL with alternates unless we call them:face_with_rolling_eyes: (edited)

[2018-10-07 10:56:19] <arpadheger1977> In this case I’d go, since there was more than enough fuel on board and knowing there is closer alternates. Arriving in AMS and you cannot land for whatever reason, call Ops on the Freq. and ask where RYR wants you to divert. If no answer or If they do not tell you, go to your first listed alternate. If they tell you, check for suitability and if ok then divert there.

Happens every day to HHN. Planned Altn STR, C1 CGN, C2/3 LUX but CGN and LUX are not listed at all. They still plan STR. I’d go CGN or if not ok then to LUX. (edited)

Sorry to bother everyone with it, but we are losing faith...

[2018-10-08 21:17:32] <oliver> Be strong guys.

I am also very often tempted to loose faith in the italian pilot community, but I am resisting, especially for those who are genuinely fighting and sticking out their necks for everybody.

Now its time to stick together.
Its time for those standing on the sides to show their support, to pitch in. We all showed them that changes are possible, now its time everybody  shows their support. (edited)

[2018-10-08 21:18:07] <remco.spelt> I know many people here in Malaga who are thinking about your situation and worried it might happen here or anywhere else in the network. I honestly don't believe that they would close the base earlier then planned... I also wish that the Dutch government, EU, ECA or Irish government could help you guys but as Ryanair gave so little time it is not helping with all the bureaucracy :pensive:

This is just another union busting technique to scare you guys. The reduction in Dublin was also irreversible and decided by the board... Yet after striking every week for multiple weeks in a row they took in a mediator and reversed the decision.:thinking_face::point_up:

:muscle:Stay strong, stay united:reminder_ribbon: and get as many facts/threads etc to the FNV/VNV and hopefully they will be able to build a "kort geding":classical_building: (fast court case) against Ryanair forcing them to reverse this:octagonal_sign:.... As we know it is not about cost saving but about breaking our unity....  
[2018-10-08 21:18:11] <ianj.barclay> In Dublin too, Maarten. Busy fighting battles here too, but you've our 100% support. Keep the faith, we'll keep the yellow lanyards flying in support :muscle::flag-nl:

To the italian pilots, be careful signing the new Anpac agreement, with the added and unecessary concilio, you are also signing away any rights from the previous contract.

A note from the lawayer:

The conciliation report (settlement agreement) implies the waiver of any previous right but in return for this waiver the company does not pay any amount by way of compromise, but only undertakes to ensure the application of an Italian employment contract and the new remuneration system.

There is no consideration for the waiver.

The application of Italian law to the employment relationship is a right and does not require a conciliation report with simultaneous waivers.

The contractual system is, on the whole, less advantageous than that which would have resulted from the application of the CCNL, under Article 36 of the Constitution, which could have been done if they had not signed the ccal.

The clause / is unlawful and discriminatory because it infringes the worker's freedom to join the union he chooses and not the union chosen by the company

There is no copy of the letter of employment to verify compliance with what was promised.  There are only waivers:

For example: will there be a probationary period or not?

The notice as it will be governed;

Will it be an employment contract with increasing safeguards? attachments: [{"from_url":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/archives\/C92CU7G76\/p1538827224000100","fallback":"[October 6th, 2018 5:00 AM] oliver: Here it comes....\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e","ts":"1538827224.000100","author_id":"U9BH9D2GM","author_subname":"Oliver Linde","channel_id":"C92CU7G76","channel_name":"04_general","is_msg_unfurl":true,"is_thread_root_unfurl":true,"text":"Here it comes....\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e","author_name":"Oliver Linde","author_link":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/team\/U9BH9D2GM","author_icon":"https:\/\/avatars.slack-edge.com\/2018-02-19\/317372726467_b28630d6a083cb1fd5a6_48.png","mrkdwn_in":["text"],"from_hidden_wksp":false,"files":[{"id":"FD8HTU9UK","created":1538827223,"timestamp":1538827223,"name":"contratto temp Anpac.pdf.pdf","title":"contratto temp Anpac.pdf","mimetype":"application\/pdf","filetype":"pdf","pretty_type":"PDF","user":"U9BH9D2GM","editable":false,"size":407419,"mode":"hosted","is_external":false,"external_type":"","is_public":true,"public_url_shared":false,"display_as_bot":false,"username":"","url_private":"https:\/\/files.slack.com\/files-pri\/T92DBBHJ6-FD8HTU9UK\/contratto_temp_anpac.pdf.pdf","url_private_download":"https:\/\/files.slack.com\/files-pri\/T92DBBHJ6-FD8HTU9UK\/download\/contratto_temp_anpac.pdf.pdf","permalink":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/files\/U9BH9D2GM\/FD8HTU9UK\/contratto_temp_anpac.pdf.pdf","permalink_public":"https:\/\/slack-files.com\/T92DBBHJ6-FD8HTU9UK-67ee0afd28"}],"id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/archives\/C92CU7G76\/p1538827224000100"}] (edited)

[2018-10-08 21:40:39] <masterharkin> The air is most certainly unstable as Storm Unity rides the North Atlantic Current as she heads east bound for mainland Europe. She is rising, She is building and She gets stronger with every nautical mile. She *will* make land but when She does, She will no longer be a little storm but a hurricane. 
[2018-10-08 21:45:04] <masterharkin> Maarten I believe there is a batch of yellow lanyards due next week. Are you willing to take it upon yourself to help drive their distribution through friends, colleagues and strangers? Are you willing to be an *army of one?* If so PM me your details and I will see to it that you get a batch. 
[2018-10-08 21:50:09] <danieltierney1> Stay strong Maarten, we're all behind you guys! We've come waaaaaay too far to turn around now! They only way to win this is to stick together and keep driving forward and I know that's what myself and everyone on this platform wants. We'll hit speed bumps along the way and there'll be times when it seems like we're on the back foot but but as long as we support each other and stay United we will win out. If Enda says that work is going on in the background then you can take that as fact! I'm sure the cavalry is coming! Myself and I know many others are  ready and waiting for orders.

[2018-10-08 22:32:45] <boston58730> Sorry to not be as vocal as I should be on this issue. So many hot topics now that it’s hard to stay up to date on each one. Like the others have said, the only way to get those bases and jobs back is through action.

Swords has definitely taken the offensive since the cease fire on their home ground; The base closures and reductions, Warsaw Aviation and already testing the boundaries with the IALPA ‘deal’.

I hope we don’t lose the initiative. They have tasted defeat now. We know they can be beaten, they know they can be beaten. I truly believe our way is not only better for us but better for the long term sustainability of the airline. These guys are just trying to squeeze every penny of bonuses out of their cronies on the board before they scurry off into the night leaving detestation in their wake.

I would like to apologise for an automated email that was sent to you yesterday in my name entitled “B737NG 2 year contract”

 

It is not the policy of our company to approach pilots who are currently working for any of our airline clients and this email was sent to you in error. We also take our responsibilities regarding GDPR very seriously and our privacy notice can be seen on our website.

 

Thank you for your understanding.

[2018-10-09 20:57:54] <kilroyrobin> Maarten my heart goes out to your colleagues and families, we are caught at a bad time of year, especially NRN BRE &amp; EIN. Rest assured that the Irish not only know exactly how you feel because we went through it, but we are infuriated and appalled that others have now been shot with the same shit. As said above "The mask has slipped even further and the monster underneath is uglier than we thought before." What is more it is absolutely clear that the fight is not nearly done. Not here, not anywhere. Even cadets in training and command upgrade students can be found in the yellow lanyard here. I am aware obviously of the frenzy of conversation in the back ground. I cannot guarantee its outcome, but I can absolutely guarantee that best efforts are in progress. The cold reality is that this is a bloody bad time of year for us and you are under severe time pressure. The monster knows it. We fought for months after month last spring to widen the gap between industrial action and this time of year, but ultimately it all ran late. The fact is though, this time of year only lasts a season. The fight in Ryanair and its increasingly pissed off pilot body will outlast that, of that I have no doubt. Your situation is absolutely inflaming the fight - although it may be a hard time of year to see evidence of that, it is not sending people for the hills. That is my honest perception.

As my collegues @maartenmegens  and @rvelthove already wrote. We are in dire need of wide spread support to bring an halt to this insanity which is going on in EIN, NRN and BRE. For months everybody has been shouting "UNITY, UNITY, UNITY!". Now that judgementday is just arround the corner, and we still don't know where our lives will end up in just a few weeks, we could use some back-up! I think now would be a good moment to put these words to action. Remember people, you might be next.
A collegue of mine quoted and adjusted the following poem from Martin Niemöller:
First they came for the Dutch base, but I did not speak out for I was not based in The Netherlands. 
Then they came for the German base, but I did not speak out for I was not based in Germany. 
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to speak out for me.

[2018-10-10 09:08:11] <jonathantaylor33> Jaysus Murray, we dont need to see the aftermath of your Lamb Balti:nauseated_face: 
[2018-10-10 10:36:06] <ralphvanderwerff> Fully supporting the earlier posted messages of my colleagues in EIN! Divide and conquer is the game Ryanair is playing and they always have. Last year we’ve started this unity movement and we should stick with it and stay strong :reminder_ribbon::muscle::skin-tone-3:, I know we will. United we stand, divided we fall! A call to all other pilots to not accept this inhuman behaviour by Ryanair. Pilots in EIN, BRE and NRN are indeed losing their precious lives out of the blue and are now going to be based elsewhere, most likely in the dark places of our network. As said before, you can be next! We need to stand up together and show Ryanair that this behaviour is not acceptable! Only then we will be able to control this beast and get the rights that we deserve. No rights, no flights! We have a part in the success of Ryanair it’s about time we’re being rewarded for it with decent contracts and conditions without any bullying or fear!

[2018-10-10 10:57:09] <ralphvanderwerff> For the benefit of the doubt and this is my opinion (thereafter I’ll be :zipper_mouth_face:). If Ryanair is to continue this type of disgusting and inhuman behaviour, then there is no reason in any country to keep negotiating anything. We’re all equals in this airline doing the same job in different countries. None of our brothers in arms should be allowed to be treated like this!  Only when Ryanair stops fighting us we can have a fair dialogue and structured negotiations in every country. Sure we (pilots) must make sacrifices on the stuff we want, both our futures (Ryanair &amp; Employees) need to get better! 

There’s only 1 to blame on the (public/financial) damage that Ryanair has suffered during the last year —&gt; Ryanair (management)! If they would have only treat(ed) us well it could have been all different...

[2018-10-10 11:54:49] <robertkolkman> The anouncement of the closure of Eindhoven base has hit me,my colleages and my family hard. I have never been the most vocal or millitant in our base but i supported our council because i  always believed that what we were asking for was fair and just. If there is anything that i have learned from the past year is that anything that is simply given can be taken away. Real change does not come for free. My thanks go out to our company council in the Dutch union who sacrificed so much time and effort to try and build some stability for us.  Let our fate not be in vain and be a warning to others across Europe.

[2018-10-10 13:42:00] <fergus.cassidy> As you all are aware. Ryanair recently announced a return to France with 2 new bases and I'm sure you've seen the BC positions posted on crewdock today.  
This will not be another Irish contract French  rules base. It is expected to be operating according to French law with taxation and social protection as every other airline in France operates. It was the French who stood up up all those years ago and said local rules apply and that is the reason for the withdrawal from france.

To the best of our knowledge the French union has sent a letter to the French transport and labour ministers warning that with the announced FR bases, the French authorities need to pay attention that they abide by the French law and social standards. 
Along with the 5 European countries who have already called together for local rules to be implemented this is a welcome turn of events.

---- 2018-10-11 ----
[2018-10-11 00:12:43] <kilroyrobin> The type of actions now taken by Ryanair management were often taken at will before the union movement ever got here, and now continue in retaliation to the union movement. This does not mean the union movement was wrong. It means it is right, and that it is here just in time. The company still thinks it can punish the pilot body for exercising its rights, and EIN would appear to be more exposed to these bully tactics than any others right now. Although the season brings an ebb tide right now, (if I can read the mood of the pilots right now, and I generally can) when season and tide turns to the flood again, management will pay for this with their jobs, just as surely as the EIN Pilots must pay now with this pain and sorrow for their families. There will be hell to pay over this for all of us. This move is like pointing your guns at your own hull. A terrible misjudgement. We in the union leadership have consistently tried to frame the change we bring as rebuilding the airline, but we cannot help what happens if management polarise their people to the point that the only thing people can see, through a fit of rage at what was done to their colleagues, is Armageddon for this company. Management are making this unmanageable for any side with this utterly backwards move. The place will be burned to the ground in a fury if they do not retract this poorly judged bullying and thuggery. I predict a war. Maybe not today, maybe not even soon, but when the season turns a tsunami is bound to be borne of this anarchical stupidity. (edited)

[2018-10-11 10:15:53] <kev1kel> To my EIN BRE and NRN colleagues. I’m really struggling with what words of encouragement I can say to you guys. I have been in RYR over 11 years now and this latest move by management is some of the worst I’ve ever seen. I understand Robin’s point regarding timing of strikes and its effectiveness at this time of year. I’m sure that’s of no comfort to you. All I can say is that everyone I speak to are also disgusted by what is happening and stand ready to down tools in support of you and your families as soon as we are called to do so. I wish you all the best over the next few uncertain weeks ahead and hope that together we can reverse this decision by management in the only manner they understand.

On the other side the light blue variant is called the Flag of Princes and has been used during the Eighty Years’ War when we drove out the Spanish ruler from our tiny Republic.

After the initial stages, Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the northern provinces continued their resistance. They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies, and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The war continued in other areas, although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened; this included the beginnings of the Dutch Colonial Empire, which at the time were conceived as carrying overseas the war with Spain.  After a 12-year truce in which the Dutch Republic achieved de facto recognition, hostilities broke out again around 1619, which can be said to coincide with the Thirty Years' War. An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of M\u00fcnster (a treaty part of the Peace of Westphalia), when the Dutch Republic was definitively recognised as an independent country no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Republic had already been recognized by Spain and the major European powers at the occasion of the Twelve Years' Truce of 1609. The Peace of M\u00fcnster is sometimes considered the beginning of the Dutch Golden Age.","fallback":"wikipedia: Eighty Years' War","service_icon":"https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/bfaba\/img\/unfurl_icons\/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eighty_Years%27_War"}]

[2018-10-11 11:43:15] <lorenzotat> Dear all,
I am a captain based in EIN, for just a few more weeks at least. I was born in this city and raised in this. My complete life is in this city. How happy was I when I was given EIN as a homebase. I was able to buy a house here, have 3 children here, build a life here and help my parents where ever they need help. 10 days ago we were told that our base is going to close. I haven't been able to breathe properly ever since. Still no idea where we're going to end up. How much that is going to cost and how often I will be able to see/help/support my family. 
I am not looking for pity. But I hope I make you realise how much we need each others support. I feel completely ignored by a company that I gave my best over the last 12 years. And for what? A couple of bucks? Heavily affecting families, girlfriends, wifes and most importantly children.

[2018-10-11 11:58:53] <swfmcmanus> Thank you for posting this Lorenzo, everyone is waiting to hear when the next move will be. As you've read you can see that many many of your collegues are ready to walk the roundabout in protest.  
[2018-10-11 12:14:10] <jsvanderknaap> As you can read from all the messages from my colleagues in Eindhoven the announcement of the EIN base closure has a big impact on the day to day life for everyone in Eindhoven. Cabin crew in probation being fired, threats of an earlier closure of the Eindhoven base if more strikes will follow and uncertainty of what the future will bring are the only things that keep us busy when we are at work. These are things that we don’t want to be thinking about when we report for work. Ryanair shouldn’t be able to have such an impact on your personal life and we should be protected by better terms and agreements than we have right now. Don’t go for the quick fix, it doesn’t give you anything on the long term. 

We will try to do anything to reverse this ridiculous decision which is a clear vengeance on our recent strikes. We hope we have the full support of you guys behind us!

[2018-10-11 13:03:22] <damiano.detomassi> I know Lorenzo from the early stages of his career in Ryanair . What this company is doing to aviation professionals around Europe directly (our dear collegues in EIN) and indirectly (arrive and cheap the competitions out of the door , example Air Italy base in Napoli closed  and their crew moved to Milan with 30 days notice ) is something we need to fight with all our strength to stop . Every single one of you that think being silent and smile will get you out of trouble think again . It’s chaos out there . One butterfly flap its wings in one side of Europe and comes a hurricane on another . (edited)
[2018-10-11 13:09:21] <ianj.barclay> Ditto to everything that has been stated so far. If we could go out on strike, no doubt we'd be there, front and centre. Be we do support you all.

This latest move by management is deplorable and nothing less than disgusting.

[2018-10-11 14:31:01] <coolhand787> Misinformation from competitor airlines  
[2018-10-11 14:38:06] <fergus.cassidy> The very airline who said last week that Ryanair needs to recruit and retain. 
[2018-10-11 14:42:05] <greggmcavan> They do and that is the truth, but as we may recall from that court case so long ago “the truth and Ryanair do not make comfortable bedfellows”  
[2018-10-11 14:47:13] <rjmaguir> Seems to me that Lundgren is clearly having a pop at O’Leary (aware that RYR haven’t hedged fuel) and so blinded by their own sociopathy are Ryanair, that they circulate this internally! :joy::man-facepalming::skin-tone-2: 
[2018-10-11 14:53:25] <fergus.cassidy> The last time oleary hedged fuel at too high a price he had to give dividends to keep the share holders happy. The fact he hasn't hedged along with all the other issues should make for some very interesting phone calls.

[2018-10-12 06:04:28] <mark_sprockel> Currently my month off and TRYING to enjoy my holiday in South Africa. As you can see TRYING in capital letters. It’s more a THINKING holiday. :thinking_face: Where will I be based?That’s the million dollar question the whole day. Two things are for sure it will not be EIN and away from my family and little baby son. :cry:

Than I think about my colleagues in EIN who are currently flying. I’m supposed to be enjoying holidays. But even now it’s not safe for me to drive a car on the left side. How can they fly with all these thoughts? :cry:

Last night before I went to bed I made sure that all my compulsory reads are gone so I can straight go to my roster the next morning. Finally know a little bit more about my future after my month off. :thinking_face:

Bravely I took my phone this morning and went straight to my roster. 5th of November TBR. TBR? :face_with_monocle:
Never heard of it. Let’s check on airports what it is. Of course nothing. 

How the :face_with_symbols_on_mouth: can they just keep doing this to all of our lives in EIN? Again uncertainty for all of us. It just wants to make you :cry:.

Please guys help us and our families.

[2018-10-12 07:15:23] <biondina> TBR probably means To Be Rostered or something like that. It’s ridiculous that they don’t have the moral sense to give you guys and girls any info about your new base. They are going to use the fact we gave you 5 weeks notice but they didn’t do that at all. It’s going to be 3 or less. We have the same in nrn well almost then. We are now all checking out our roster to see if we are 1 of the unlucky ones that will be moved away from the base. The WhatsApp group exploded this morning when the roster came out and everyone so far still has NRN in their roster. I hope you can still enjoy your holiday and don’t let this bullshit effect your time with your family to much. I have November off and I wanted to book a nice holiday as well, but now in the back of my mind I’m thinking will I stay in nrn or am I going to be moved and if they move me can I still afford to go on holiday and do I have time to go on holiday or do I need to set up a polish company. That’s not the thing you want to focus on it should be do I want garden or ocean view. 

Success end sterkte de komende weken en geniet van je vakantie voor zover dat gaat.

For sure will not come out of this month like a rested person, but I will be able to look at myself in the mirror. Hopefully unity will prevail and the good times are coming.

[2018-10-12 13:32:05] <oliver> Anpac has signed his deal, wasnt that the excuse to get out of ECA and RTPG until it was done?
Now if they have a grain of self respect they should either join again or tell everyone the truth, that they are not interested in our well being. (edited)
[2018-10-12 13:41:59] <jwarren> Anpac couldn’t care less about its own members, why would they care about other countries. 
[2018-10-12 13:52:41] <oliver> Exactly, it should be time to join in masse UIL and get them in ECA.

PS in the last weeks Anpac recycled itself and together with Anpav formed the FiNTA union (of course president still DeCarlo). At the government aviation reform table, the only thing they had to suggests (I kid you not), was that the real problem in Italy is the fact that pilots and cabin crews sick days have to be paid by the employer and this is not correct, they suggest INPS (government retirement fund) to start paying those days as an incentive to help restart the airlines.
I could not believe it either but that is Anpac’s highest problem in Italy......, to make sure the airlines get an extra “cost savings” to their social requirements. (edited)

[2018-10-13 10:36:31] <maartenmegens> Question:

Does anyone have or remember a memo about base transfer priority during a base closure?

We are trying to counter them with facts. Direct Entry Captains getting base priority, expansions in Belgium and Portugal, different base opportunities for CU and us (EIN, BRE, NRN, GRO and Poland). 

I know it sounds like all we do is complain about our own situation, but we realise we have been fortunate enough to have been at home for a few years. Other crew in Ryanair have never even had this chance. We know.
But after 17 years in the company, of which 12years commuting, to be 'rewarded' like this, leaves a bit of a bad taste. We are still in the fight. And it looks like we care about ourselves, now, which is no more than we can muster at moment. It's a lot to process in a very short time. But if we succeed, this will be for a better future for all crews in Ryanair!
We are happy to read the support from our brothers and sisters around the network!

[2018-10-13 11:36:38] <kilroyrobin> Maarten you are absolutely justified to be talking about yourselves right now, I can assure you it is what all of us are trying to resolve right now. The bitter truth is that the season gives FR the distinct strategic advantage right now. I personally am appalled and deeply insulted by the true colours of those who would sign letters to people such as you offering you an end to your family life simply to punish you for exercising your rights. I am more determined now than ever that those of us who acted in 2018, acted for very good reason. As a huge transnational group we the pilot body are clumsy on time targets, but yet we are ever clearer in our targets that we need to change. This will take time, and time that sadly you do not have, but the snipers who now pick off those left in the open with apparent impunity for this season will reap a world of pain. There is a declaration of war, and there is a cause for that. The cause will pay. This is not a threat I make, this is a simple statement of balance and probability, the cause of your pain today will surely pay for this tomorrow. Fury is a very unhealthy emotional for a company to feed in its own people, and people are furious at this. *Furious*

When I joined this company in 2005 I was proud. I shined my shoes for Ryanair. 

Then I couldn’t get a Dublin base, in an Irish Company, because I was Irish. I still shined my shoes, but now I did so for my profession instead. 

My first year as a Captain was the toughest, I shined my shoes for Boeing for a short while, I couldn’t believe I had one, but it wasn’t long before I was back shining my shoes for my profession again. 

The endless snow of 2010/2011 put wrinkles in my leather, but still I shined my shoes for my profession. 

The endless storms of 2013/2014, the windiest winter on record in EIDW since 1944 put manners on all of us, while my feet booted rudders like no year since or before they did so with a shine put there for my proud profession. 

In 2018 the marching began, I walked for my profession, and I put a shine on those shoes for my profession. 

This morning though it was hard, to shine those shoes,  I had to remind myself - I do this for my proud profession - not for the pigs that disrespect our colleagues, that disrespect our profession with the toxic and appalling abuse of EIN, NRN and BRE. 

We maintain our standards for our profession.  

The company has yet to learn that a pilots discipline comes from their proud profession, from their vocation, from facing the elements, from the winters and the storms, from our colleagues and experience, from a knowledge of ourselves, not from them!

It does not come from and will never come from that very particular brand of bullying issued by soft minded pencil pushers that would fall to pieces like gibbering fools if they ever had to face those times where we have to come into our own as our proud profession demands. 

I still shined my shoes today, the better to march again.

[2018-10-14 05:13:31] <remco.spelt> Very true, we have to remain as professional how hard it might be with what is going on for many years...  
[2018-10-14 06:41:26] <damiano.detomassi> As you said , for the Profession .  
[2018-10-14 08:20:11] <rvelthove> Amen 
[2018-10-14 08:22:02] <spac> I've heard the Polish Option is being prepared for the UK. Any truth in the rumour? 
[2018-10-14 08:32:47] <tomflood737> Excellent, and ironically fits in with EW’s claim  that the IRCC were looking at their shoes during the 11th hour meeting on the 11th of July, on the eve of the first of five strikes. 

What EW really meant by his statement about the IRCC negotiating team, “looking at their shoes”, was “that while I was spouting garbage in my usual fashion, the IRCC refused to budge and instead focussed on the dot on the wall for the betterment of their proud profession.” 
[2018-10-14 08:37:49] <tomflood737> Warsaw Radiation is the prototype that will speed across Europe if let.  
[2018-10-14 08:52:50] <tuhhodge> Isn't the Polish option merely the Brookfield/Storm etc self employment model with added liability clauses?  
[2018-10-14 08:56:43] <kilroyrobin> The spouting was soooo much easier to endure with an independent third party sitting at the end of the table. Passively observing as the gun slinger empties a magazine into his trendy runners would leave you in good shape.  
[2018-10-14 09:00:42] <tomflood737> Most probably, but we should be going in the opposite direction. If let contaminate the rest of Europe it’ll b used to circumvent Union Recognition. Remember permanent employees are being forced out of their permanent jobs.  
[2018-10-14 09:06:39] <tuhhodge> Of course, however I understand the Polish option's instigation in Poland is only possible due to Polish law being almost as antiquated as Irish law. I don't think it's possible in the UK. UK pilots are not employed by Ryanair DAC but by Ryanair UK, so theoretically they could try the same trick here. Mind you, someone told me they've obtained a UK AOC in the name of Ryanair UK? 
[2018-10-14 09:13:37] <rvelthove> As sad as it is, if this issue is not fixed I might have shined these shoes for the last time as I will not leave my family for some far away hole in the ground. I still want to stay in the fight, but it's up to the generals now to give marching orders, or wait out  strategically for now. By doing the latter we are left behind enemy lines and in not sure if I can survive long enough for the rescue party to arrive.. Do what is best, but never surrender!!

[2018-10-14 09:27:49] <masterharkin> I reckon the mail would read something like this.................. “Due to the cost of the barrel now approaching $100 with other airlines going bankrupt and the continued lack of participation of the Unions in accepting our improved salaries of up to 20% not to mention our outstanding term &amp; conditions we are left with no alternative but to *shut down Ryanair UK with immediate effect.* There will however be an opportunity to join Warsaw Aviation. These places are very limited and we would encourage you to apply straightaway, otherwise we shall assume you want to avail of your statutory redundancy of 2 weeks for every year served.”

Amazon, Sports Direct, Hermes, Brookfield Aviation, Storm, BBC, Sudent Loans Company and the NHS all make extensive use of zero hours contracts.

apparently caused by wx in OPO were plane diverted from....but still bare minimum (if we would have an proper CLA) would be food, water, overnight compensation and sector pay for all sectors for the whole crew:point_up:

Update : at least 5 guys have been called to operate planes (From OPO) from AGP. People taken off 2 days of rostered duty and paid only for 1 ferry flight :face_vomiting:

Update 2: apparently fighting passengers in Malaga terminal with Lesma handling. Crews from OPO still in crewroom at 0530 this morning, wonder if they had an hotel or sleep there.... 

Will see if I can get more information (anyone from <#C93EHBQHZ|base_opo> who can give updates what it was like yesterday in OPO, 4 planes diverted)  (edited)

[2018-10-14 11:47:06] <tuhhodge> Yes. We know that. It wasn't the point made. Are contractors paying employer's NI in the UK? 
[2018-10-14 11:51:13] <jeremy.luca> Due to wx only 1 out of 8 ac made it to OPO last night.  
[2018-10-14 12:29:01] <greggmcavan> Yes they do Tom 

Employees are the owners/directors so they pay twice 
[2018-10-14 12:29:55] <boston58730> Contractors have been paying NI in the UK for over 5 years now. Strictly speaking it is your company which pays it but in any case not FR or BRK/STM. I had so many guys tell me that it was an illegal set up for the UK but between myself and a friend from flight training we have had 3 audits and no problems.

I understand that what you are saying is that the Warsaw Aviation contract is just a worse version of BRK/STM. 

What worries me is how the Polish bases have been forced into signing it. The rubbish conditions of the contract are a secondary concern.  
[2018-10-14 12:43:35] <nilsholdrinet> Because it's as far as possible from EIN, BRE and NRN. It's the company being vindictive and just plain evil to our brave colleagues who stood up for their rights. 

Also if you have any sort of evidence that PDL is fully staffed, it might be useful to send it to the VNV CC or VC CC. They might be able to use it in the upcoming court cases  (edited)

the crew arrived very late in the morning, attempts were made to find a hotel but all rooms were 100% booked. The crew spent some time in the crew room until  LESMA staff arrived at 0515.  From there they were allowed access to the VIP lounge. Hotel was booked for 11.45 that morning- best ops could do. However the OPO crew turned down the hotel and positioned to OPO.:thinking_face:

Maybe even the billionaire himself may fall upon the sword of greed with which he cuts us now in that mindless imploding vortex of profit before all else, not even common sense. All this in order to serve a few, even before the basic standards of humanity for the many. The sword they live by cuts both ways just like any other - let no one forget. We may be wounded but we are many, and we won’t forget.

[2018-10-15 01:11:30] <kilroyrobin> True, and many more before them.  
[2018-10-15 01:34:48] <kilroyrobin> Incredible to imagine this a year ago. I remember you said to me once that you like the political side of our fight. I know exactly what you mean. First we fight in defence, but it is wider ideal that really drives a fight home for the greater good. That is addictive. Doing the right thing is addictive. (edited)
[2018-10-15 06:45:35] <jessica.emurphy2009> Amazing job to the guys and gals in Germany and I was so proud watching you all I started tearing up and how you talked about our brothers and sisters in Eindhoven and base closures. We can not be broken we have each other. 
[2018-10-15 06:45:43] <coolhand787> Hello Robin thank you for this Monday Morning poetry! How right you are! I keep shining my shoes but that’s because I am proud of who I am and what I do as skillfully as possible just like my fellow colleagues be it in the cabin or the flight deck. I am reading the book on MOL! Not an eye opener but definitely puts the man’s psychological profile into very clear perspective! Shameless heartless ruthless money hungry individual! Profit at all costs! The human factor according MOL must remain inhumain! RYR MUST CHANGE!

[2018-10-15 06:55:28] <fergus.cassidy> The must change and MOL and cohorts must go. With a psychological profile so embedded it can never change. For him their will never be a turning point when he becomes humsn again if ever he was. Brave souls like the cabin crew in Berlin standing up on stage telling the public the truth is what is needed. The public are voting with their credit cards flying elsewhere.
I'm starting to see a lot of short haul flights now with 20 plus passengers not turning up. Who's buying those seats for load factor %. 
Robin, start writing thst book. It'll be a bestseller.

[2018-10-15 14:00:52] <padibartolomeo> I am not so sure Marco , who told you that?  I remember when we were told countless times that we could only strike for 4hrs according to Italian law, and then a 24 hrs strike was announced in July by a number of Italian unions. I strongly doubt  it was arranged out of the law . Oh, and it was a pan European strike . (edited)

Hereby a small update from niederrhein as i did not see anything posted on slack.

All the people that called sick after receiving their letter on friday evening unfit to fly have been summoned to dublin for a disciplinary meeting.

We know RYR has no shame and an immoral core, but how can irish authorities allow this? 
[2018-10-16 16:09:54] <boston58730> Suggest you guys print out “Stress and Stress Management” from e-learning (just search RST 3) and take it with you.

Make sure you read through OMA Chapter 6 and if you have time, make an appointment with your Doctor/AME.

They will try to argue that you could not have been too stressed if you didn’t seek medical attention.

[2018-10-16 16:13:25] <boston58730> You can make the appointment for after your meeting at HQ and show details of the appointment at the meeting and thereafter cancel the appointment if you do not want to keep it.

In any case acute stress due to a known cause should not affect your medical.

Apparently ZAD base closing permantly... Crew informed a week ago, last flight of the base 27th... Bases/choices offered :
Ryr sun, German bases, and BCN offered, mayby Dublin and Bergamo and worst of all (what we all feared became reality.... STN self-employment contract (same as Ryr sun but then with British Aviation company, you have to open your own 1 person company, pay taxes and social yourself and you are responsible for everything.)

[2018-10-16 21:00:16] <hrvojesucic> Pilots haven’t been told anything yet. It’s still unofficial and coming from cabin crew because they had a meeting today with their bosses from STN. No memos or any kind of solid information, only half-rumors. BC is being kept in the dark just like the rest of us. The last flight on the 27th was scheduled as the last flight of the season months ago, has nothing to do with not reopening ZAD. We’re all pissed, the majority of us is in ZAD because our families are close (myself having wife and 3 children living in Croatia).  (edited)

[2018-10-16 21:10:39] <hrvojesucic> It’s as if they’re looking to set up a “clean” start everywhere in terms of some change. Maybe cancel old contracts, issue new ones, with even worse conditions... 
[2018-10-16 21:18:16] <kilroyrobin> Genuine Recognition it seems will only come after a genuine day of reckoning. The worst seems yet to come for either side now unfortunately. This is not a course set by our side. We are the ones being repeatedly rammed below the waterline here and it is our right to defend ourselves. It’s time for everyone and everybody with a skill, a gift, time to spare, or no bloody time at all to spare to report to your local company council and ask not what they can do for you, but what you can do for them. All hands to the pumps, pick up survivors and move forward, what ships we may loose this autumn will not rob us of our whole fleet for the fight ahead. You don’t surrender 86 ships because we have taken our first casualties. Never think of your base as one lone ship in this fight, all our bases must be a fleet. The bitter truth here is there is no survivable retreat from this. There is only onwards.

[2018-10-16 23:30:13] <ginosabatino> Serks great words of advice. We all know hiw strict german ame’s are, and in light of recent events stress is treated with utmost importance. If 20 of you send a 2 week sick note to them, that will cause them a massive headache, and give yourselves time to take stock

[2018-10-17 15:02:52] <masterharkin> That just shows how important a Seniority List is for base closures. The quicker every MA in every country get theirs set up the better for you all. 
[2018-10-17 15:11:53] <coolhand787> Absolutely Stephen then all this musical chairs game with base transfers will cease, plus it will hinder RYR for just bumping crews around at will in punishment!  
[2018-10-17 15:15:35] <coolhand787> I really think those flight crew’s Union should make a breach of GDPR by RYR lawsuit! This is totally illegal. And as Stephen said releasing CCTV footage for public viewing without the consent of the individual is punishable by law. Try doing the same against RYR and you will quickly see how they will come down on you like a ton of bricks!

[2018-10-17 16:17:15] <remco.spelt> @boston58730 bet Ryanair had a totally different reaction from the public.... Instead exposing them more, mayby some heads will roll in HQ:mantelpiece_clock:. Tomorrow post of Ryanair : "we regret that of our social media workers decided to put the footage of that night online without blurring /consulting crew, however it shows the crew had fantastic first class chairs and even couches available as well as an vending machine for food and drinks and free water as we provide to all our crews in the network":face_vomiting::face_with_symbols_on_mouth: 
[2018-10-17 16:24:09] <dohpau> SPAC is aware of this situation. I've already made the lawyer aware, touched base with SNPVAC and made Alejandro from SEPLA aware that we will possibly need guidance on Spanish law in the very near future.
If someone knows how to screen record the fact this exists in case the tweet is later deleted it would be appreciated. (edited)
[2018-10-17 16:41:03] <boston58730> Maybe we should count ourselves lucky they don’t charge us to sleep in the crew rooms...yet.

[2018-10-17 17:41:59] <brendanjacobs> They have the signs everywhere. This was not ‘the social media’ team. This was a direct order from a senior manager. I hope to fuck every one of those crew members sues the fucken shit out of them!

[2018-10-17 20:31:36] <boston58730> Seem to recall hearing they found rooms for flight deck but not for crew. 
[2018-10-17 22:54:30] <dohpau> No flight deck were put in hotel rooms as far as I'm aware. Spent the night in the same crew room and lounge as the cabin crew. 
[2018-10-17 23:10:37] <mac_wessie> All 24 crew spent the night together in the crew room and airport lounge. The captains bought breakfast for their respective crew in the morning since LESMA wouldn't help due to lack of a authorization email DUB OPS never sent

[2018-10-18 06:55:46] <boston58730> Wishful thinking on my part then. Dub ‘oops’ advised they tried to pay for breakfast but unfortunately it was sold out in all of Iberia. 
[2018-10-18 09:07:50] <boswellbrown> Marcus, recording is one thing, but publishing on the open web is the big legal No, No! 
[2018-10-18 11:25:42] <tyronebloem> Question! If you change base, how many days you should get to change from one base to another? Is that anywhere written?! Thanks  
[2018-10-18 11:32:25] <iglehane> Unfortunately not. The shortest I’ve had is 3 weeks. The mobility clause in the contracts let’s them do what they like. 
[2018-10-18 11:37:11] <robertgormley53> I thought it was in the FTLs you needed to have 72 hours in a new base before you could operate?  
[2018-10-18 12:08:01] <brendanjacobs> It’s just n there somewhere  
[2018-10-18 12:08:10] <brendanjacobs> Don’t have iPad to hand 
[2018-10-18 12:43:27] <fergus.cassidy> Chapter 7.8 Ops Man, part A. 

In the case if a change of home base, the first recurrent extended recoveryrest period prior to starting duty at the new home base is increased to 72 hours, including 3 local nights. Travelling time between the former home base and the new home base us positioning.

[2018-10-18 15:19:30] <andy.airamerica> @iglehane There is no such thing as a mobility clause now. This was removed with the Irish pilots seniority agreement.  
	:muscle: mrbradleyheap
[2018-10-18 16:26:30] <masterharkin> So that’s a lie then? It’s not Direct Entry Captain at all. You join Ryanair as an FO. Check out the T&amp;C’s at the bottom. 
[2018-10-18 17:07:51] <thomas> "Non-Type Rated Captains will join our Fast Track to Command Programme". Indeed the title is misleading. Also the title makes it seem like RYR is looking for Turbo Prop pilots.  
[2018-10-18 17:52:28] <boston58730> The airlines going under may be small but 2 aircraft here and 5 there soon add up. With the oil price still climbing the remaining carriers won’t be so bullish in their expansion.

I fear we’re losing the initiative here guys. If we don’t make a move soon this movement is going to die. Make no mistake if we allow them to get the upper hand they will split us, isolate us and make us pay dearly for embarrassing them. (edited)

Trust me if IAA would agree they would hire DEC from Turboprops. But I suppose the regulator does not approve of this! Energy management is different as we know. I imagine a DEC ex turboprop flying a SFP aircraft into CRL with 20kts TWC at 1500ft MSL. Bottom line RYR is desperate for flightdeck crews! This would also explain the base closures! And blaming it on striking pilots and Cabin crew! Consolidation of pilots ... AGB :face_vomiting::face_vomiting::face_vomiting:

[2018-10-18 20:09:23] <ralphvanderwerff> Today was a big day in Dutch court, Ryanair vs Ryanair Pilots, a day I could have never imagined. Who thought I would ever have to compete against my employer? Unfortunately today was that day! Why? Because me and my colleagues in Eindhoven Base had to fight for our (social) rights. Why? Because Ryanair is breaching all of them. Today another day, even in court, full of lies. Mister Hughes didn’t show one little fraction of empathy when Pilots told the judge that their lives and the lives of their families were taken away with the closure of Eindhoven Base. No, according to Ryanair it was purely a business/economical decision with no retaliation involved at all for the industrial action of the Eindhoven Pilots. Remember that industrial action was our right and by closing Eindhoven it was taken away from us. Just like base closures seem to be happening more frequently now, you can be next. 

During today’s court case the judge proposed a possibility to settle and therefore suspended the hearing for 15 minutes to see if Ryanair and their pilots would be able to come to an agreement. But no, Ryanair was clear even though the pilots reached out once again: “Eindhoven will close permanently, period”. Now it’s up to the judge to show some guts and to finally punish Ryanair for it’s disgusting and inhuman behaviour. We had a good case, let’s hope the verdict is in our favour (can take up to 14 days)! Possibilities are a social plan, compensation, a base closer to home (other than the deserted places Ryanair offered us) or hopefully a return to Eindhoven Base in case it re-opens summer 2019. To keep Eindhoven open as a result of today’s court hearing is a very very slim chance. Once again, we urge all other countries to reconsider their current negotiations since in our opinion there is no point in continuing any talks. Ryanair is making great progress to divide us, it’s time we stand up again all together, enough is enough! Let’s show some unity again :reminder_ribbon:. United we stand &amp; divided we fall! Time for us to take revenge with the final goal in mind: changing Ryanair to an airline where you are proud to work for, socially, safely and happily ever after. No rights no flights! No more fear. 

Today was a stressful, emotional and exhausting day...

[2018-10-19 06:39:19] <rvelthove> Could not have said it better Ralph, thanks a lot, spot on! 
Me too have lost faith in a reopening of Eindhoven base this winter after yesterday, although I am pretty sure they want to reopen it in April as they can hold the slots for 6 months apparently.  
The question is if we will ever get it back. 

I truly think that we are on the final crossroad and have to choose for a better Ryanair or settle for something a *bit* less.
The latter might sound interesting if you consider what they did to some of us (by the way they announced in court 14 more bases will be closed this year - don't forget to feel intimidated, and thanks for letting all these crews know that their life will also be smashed- sarcasm off)  
but we all know what happens when you make an almost watertight deal with this employer: your ship will soon sink..

So once again I ask everybody to think real careful about the exit you will take, it's left or right, left might seem like a paved road and shallow turn, but you cannot see what's around the corner...!  Right is a steep turn on a road full of holes and lots of gravel, but the view after this almost 180 degree turn is amazing and like we might have seen somewhere in the past, or read about in magazines. This might probably be our last chance to go right, and really unite.

[2018-10-19 08:11:44] <remco.spelt> Sharp right turn definitely, we have to choose our tactic wisely as for example striking in Spain (in Malaga for example) is not having much effect as last time 75% of the flights was minimum service, not calling a strike and mass amount of not fit to fly (with doctor certificate stating not fit to fly for a week) + no stdby will have a huge effect.... Or just simply everyone show up 45min before and try start printing all together and walk very slowly to airplanes and then there will be huge delays, missed slots and crew out of hours.... 

Question here is, what can we legally do what will have the most effect? and without breaking any of the laws&amp; least direct damage to us the pilots.... (edited)

Don’t get me wrong it’s easy for us to ask but none of your brothers in arms should be treated like this. We’re all equals working in different countries. Even though it seems like there is nothing to lose for us, there is. Our personal, social, working and family lives are at stake. People in EIN are knocked down and emotionally exhausted, still no base allocation with two weeks to go. However, we’ll stand strong until the last second, we won’t fall but definitely need help from our allies :pray::skin-tone-2:. A shame it feels we’re begging but what can we do?

[2018-10-21 16:31:25] <marconania> There is something I don’t like in the leave system, what do you think?

The captain’s seniority list in my opinion should be based on the time you signed a cpt contract. 
It is not acceptable that someone who delayed the upgrade for 10 years for whatever reason then jumps in front of the que whit his date of entry...
 Any thoughts? 
[2018-10-21 16:33:53] <brendanjacobs> Are you talking about Ryanair’s Leave system or the seniority agreement? 
[2018-10-21 16:34:17] <robertgormley53> My view is that it shouldn't matter. I wouldn't see it as jumping any queue. 
[2018-10-21 16:35:12] <damiano.detomassi> seniority is seniority , SFIs delay command for a good reason . BA and LH have the same system as once in u are a number . U of course only compete with same role . But a year 6 Cpt is junior to a year 12 FO upgraded to Cpt . Correct ? What I think it can happen if the company matures and people think of staying and not upgrading to go elsewhere is that someone stay in base of choice until that base becomes available for his seniority number and then goes for command. Same for leave . This is how easyJet works right now . So if they can make it work so can we ? (edited)

[2018-10-21 16:38:18] <oliver> It is exactly correct that the seniority is simply date of entry.

Its not correct that for example a cpt that gets a demotion would start from scratch if he upgraded again, or that a pilot 5 years in a company once upgraded would be behind a new 1 year “old” OCC CPT.
Or again in case of base closure, a 5 year pilot in the company but freshly upgraded would but bumped a let say 3 month brand new OCC guy.

Seniority should always be on date of entry period. Than rank can be used for other issues. (edited)

[2018-10-21 16:39:38] <ginosabatino> If someone has been loyal for 10 years its still loyal, regardless of rank. Many have reasons to delay uograde, kids, family, not being able o move away, or perhaps they fail upgrade, it shouldnt stand in their way if they have been loyal for 10 years 
[2018-10-21 16:39:40] <marconania> Brendan, I am referring to ryr’s leave system not the msl 
[2018-10-21 16:40:43] <damiano.detomassi> Wouldn’t it be the same as the seniority controlled leave  is something we also want ? (edited)
[2018-10-21 16:42:06] <brendanjacobs> That ABC play school rubbish is a load of shit. That’s why we’re pushing for a Leave system that works on points and Seniority, by date of entry as the tie breaker in case of conflicting Leave applications. I assume Italy is one of the ‘over 10 countries’ to have it implemented? (edited)
[2018-10-21 16:43:29] <marconania> Let’s say I was a cabin crew before, would my seniority take into account that period of time as well? I have been a loyal employee...
What do you think Gino? (edited)
[2018-10-21 16:45:58] <damiano.detomassi> Marco , I think u resigned before taking up employment as pilot . FO to Cpt is a upgrade like JU to PU. Don’t mess things up buddy;-) 
[2018-10-21 16:45:59] <brendanjacobs> This was considered, that time served in another position should be counted. Whether that’s in full or factored is up for discussion. This is something that could be pushed by other MA’s in negotiations  
[2018-10-21 16:46:51] <damiano.detomassi> then people that served 2 or more terms in Ryanair and returned should have their total years counted also? Super Loyal like Lessie , always comes home . (Same as COO) (edited)

[2018-10-21 16:53:54] <masterharkin> There seems to be a little confusion here guys. Just to clarify. Ireland does not in anyway support Ryanair’s new leave proposal. We think any leave system that allows for the removal of up to 3 of your annual leave days is outrageous. The IALPA Ryanair Company Council leave system that the guys and girls worked so hard on has now been tested through applications for 2019 2020 2021 with large numbers of Pilots and it turned out to be perfectly balanced. It would be my view that the new RYANAIR LEAVE SYSTEM is not fit for purpose. (edited)

[2018-10-21 17:09:24] <kilroyrobin> Marco when adopting this new seniority system we researched many other airlines. They all informed us that you cannot use seniority based on rank, otherwise you give the company a point of leverage which coerces people to go for command when they either are not ready, or classically a company might say “good news Marco, you are getting an opportunity to get on the command seniority list, regrettably due to market conditions you will be on this 20% pay cut”.... etc. Everyone keeping their DOE removes this point of leverage from the company and returns it to the Pilot. All the big carriers use one list. If you want proof ask yourself why did the company fight us tooth and nail to get a two list system. Because it benefits their position and not ours.  
[2018-10-21 17:16:53] <kilroyrobin> Remember you have to think about what is best for the collective pilot group, not what is good for my half of the Pilots, or even just for me. If you work for the council as an FO for example, or don’t do a duty which involves sleeping on a floor for example, presenting the company an opportunity to delay your entry on the command seniority list by using a dual list system is a completely disproportionate point of power for management. Members will have take some confidence that the transnational group that researched this system, and that put many hundreds of hours of research into this were not faffing around, they were doing their level best to get the right answer. If everyone disintegrates the work to date by splintering off in all directions we will have wasted an opportunity for unity.  
[2018-10-21 17:17:03] <marconania> Thanks for the explanation Robin, it makes more sense now... Unfortunately I have no experience with other airlines, I spent the last 13 years with these fuckers:weary: 
[2018-10-21 17:19:26] <marconania> But again, I was only talking about the leave system.. not the msl as it is not implemented in Italy  
[2018-10-21 17:24:34] <squaadgras> I’ve dedicated 4 years as a SFI to this company. I am approaching 7 years right seat in a few months. Should someone like me be lower on any MSL than someone that went leftie after 3,5 years in the company? Or DEC? ... And why?

I would say that is not only unfair to those investing time in the company - it will lead to a serious shortage of trainers as many will no longer opt to become a trainer until after their upgrade. 

Interesting topic though. (edited)

[2018-10-21 17:32:13] <peter.j.marriott> Under the proposed union leave system at what point would a DEC start getting leave requests approved.  
[2018-10-21 17:38:01] <squaadgras> It depends on the amount of points offered, which dates are chosen (popular/unpopular), if A/L has previously be assigned, etc. Seniority will only come in play if -say- both pilots bid the same amount of points on a particular date and only one will be allowed to enjoy A/L afaik. It rotates fairly among all pilots - so DEC do not have to worry and wait years before they finally get their requested A/L. Probably best for one of the specialist to reply to this topic - but the A/L tests shown very promising (and fair) results of what I’ve heard. (edited)
[2018-10-21 17:48:02] <brendanjacobs> Edited: Sören’s explanation was better!..... Ryanair’s fake ‘seniority based’ system has so many issues that could leave pilots in the ‘bottom’ group for over 4 years. I think we’re getting a bit mixed up as to how much of an effect seniority actually plays in the points based system. It’s just the tie breaker, rather than Ryanair dictating who gets that Leave based on their ‘matrix’. (edited)
[2018-10-21 17:55:22] <brendanjacobs> Just in defence of @marconania There seems to be a mix up. Marco has a problem with Ryanair determining seniority by ‘group’. Which creates unfairness. The other system where seniority reigns supreme, with regard Leave, is that the senior guys always get what they want and tough for everyone else. That’s why the points based system we’ve proposed is the most fair. As Robin said A LOT of work has gone into this. Unlike Ryanair, WE have put fairness and transparency as the basis for all these proposals.

---- 2018-10-22 ----
[2018-10-22 07:06:38] <fourdonks> A single seniority list generally only used in airlines where everyone joins as an FO (eg BA, VS, CX etc - easyJet is an exception - and I do know I pulled out from joining easy, because it was very bad for new recruits and junior crew - although [@damiano.detomassi] even easyJet don't do base transfers by seniority, they do it by application date). At Ryanair, pilots join as both FOs and Captains - (and upgrades are not particularly delayed by DECs, which are pretty much essential for growth for the foreseeable). 

It's also unrealistic to believe that seniority would only occasionally come into play if it were used for leave bidding - no, there's bound to be clashes, (within a bid group) because most people (especially with kids) would bid for school holidays and mid summer, so direct entry Captains (who are stuck at the bottom for years and years) would get the popular periods much less easily. Sorry, but seniority is a disgusting concept and it's the antithesis of treating equal pilots equally - its the school ground equivalent of looking down on the new kid and treating him or her worse. Outside the airline industry, it would be unthinkable, and even within, it is dying out - the ones who still use it mainly ONLY use it to decide in what order to give command assessments and upgrades. That said, I would, and always have regarded SFIs as in effect Captains, and would expect to see their seniority start as Captain whenever they become an SFI. (edited)
[2018-10-22 07:28:33] <robertgormley53> I think the leave system proposed by the council in Ireland, uses a points-based system to ensure fairness. So that it wouldn't be the case that one always gets for example xmas and the first 2 weeks in July off, if you're high up the seniority list 
[2018-10-22 07:33:06] <fourdonks> In a previous life, we used points, but there was still quite often a clash for popular periods. I forget what differentiator they used to decide who got it, but I do know it wasn't seniority. They did use just 6 total points, so lots of people had the same number of points - I guess if the year were to have maybe 20 or 50 points periods, then clashes would be less frequent. (edited)
[2018-10-22 07:46:12] <robertgormley53> It's a shame you can't remember as it would be interesting to know. Was it maybe randomised to decide any clashes? Something like that may be completely fair. My only concern, especially in this company, would be who is doing the 'randomizing'? I think the least amount of weapons at their disposal the better. Using seniority to decide on clashes would be transparent. And I think a points system based over a few years would limit the amount of clashes. Finally, I do think there has to be at least some reward / incentive for an individual to stay long-term, especially at this company. The amount of experience walking out the door here is shocking. Edit: Simon I just saw your edit lol and yes I think the low number of points could have been the issue. The leave system proposed here I believe, is based over several years to mitigate that issue arising. (edited)
[2018-10-22 07:51:24] <fourdonks> I think it was randomised. Random numbers have a certain purity, (assuming they genuinely are random)! As for rewarding loyalty, I agree, but loyalty bonuses seem to be favoured method these days. 

Why do you think management are going along with the idea of seniority? - Simple - because they can pay us less, and still keep the more experienced pilots (because the senior pilots would be reluctant to lose the seniority advantages and quit go elsewhere - seniority has always been the enemy of pilot pay). Until I saw Marco's post, I've bit my lip about saying it publicly so far, but a do regard seniority as step back into airline dark ages! (edited)
[2018-10-22 08:15:48] <robertgormley53> Yeh this is it, assuming the randomisation is genuinely random. Unfortunately I don't believe with the way the company acts it would be the case. Look at the manner in which certain base transfers have been conducted up until now. 'Random' is one way of putting it :) And as for loyalty bonuses. Money? In this place? Do you want to give MOL a heart attack?! :)  
[2018-10-22 08:34:59] <fourdonks> The CCs could generate the random numbers, (5 minutes on a spreadsheet) so everyone can be happy they are not tampered with. Anyway, if clashes would be rare, it's not really important - rather it's the concept that every time a pilot see their seniority number used in some way, it is like a reminder that they are "beneath" or "lesser" than other pilots - it's ugly. The crucial thing, with leave and with base transfers - is transparency. (edited)
[2018-10-22 08:51:41] <robertgormley53> My only fear there is if someone didn't get for example, Xmas off for the 2nd or 3rd time in a row due to bad luck, could lead to accusations of foul play on the part of the CC. In my opinion it would inevitably lead to accusations of favouritism based on personal relationships, bribes etc. I think randomisation is a perfect solution in a perfect world. But I don't think we live in one. Personally I think seniority is the most transparent system as it is indisputable.  
[2018-10-22 12:41:11] <ginosabatino> Very interesting debate. Until we get enough crews its all a bit of a moot point as never enough crew to give out leave in summer anyway!

[2018-10-22 16:31:00] <kilroyrobin> Simon I can see that you feel put out by seniority because you are a direct entry Captain, but here is some food for thought. We have a 4 year employment cycle here. You are probably well on your way to the top half of the seniority list anyway. After 2 years you’ll be in the top half :ok_hand:. The system simply takes the decision from management as to who they can pick for downsizing. The system they revealed in mediation involved a matrix which included *refusal to use commanders discretion and sickness*. Your position that seniority would be unacceptable elsewhere is completely unfair. LIFO is a fundamental principle of normal labour relations. LIFO is Seniority. You have to consider the collective and not the individual, to be honest I have spoken to countless people who operate under a seniority system on the road to drawing up this proposal, but you are the first to complain about it, aside from some other DECs who have already been assigned a base transfer ahead of another. I welcome DECs as they are good for growth, but that is only the case because we are incapable of retaining our own people here, keeping home grown Captains is (by the companies own account) a far better deal because they grow up under our system and standards. DEC can be good but can be a totally unknown quantity. Ask anyone who has trained here for a while whats the maddest stuff they have seen, and you’ll get a common answer. I have also trained fantastic DEC’s but the point is it is a relative unknown, and both as their FO and later as their trainer I have seen some DECs fall far short of ideal. The ideal for an airline targeting its best possible standards is good training with people who want to stay. As you say, people want to stay for seniority. With your statement that seniority brings pay down consider this. 10 years ago an FO earned €39000 basic which is €48000 in today’s money. When I was FO here I earned even more than that again. But today’s FO earns €24000 basic. Yes that’s right. *half!* We did not need seniority to get a pay cut. We chose seniority to stop victimisation, to stop fear, to stop bullying, to stop managements selectively matrixes being used in downsizing, and all of this to promote the confidence in people that they can when all else fails take industrial action without repercussions. It’s that last bit that brings the strength to achieve everything else. Pilot retention is critical. It is needed for safety margins. A new upgrade captain has a 20% chance of an incident in their first 12 months. (FR SMS data) It is bad airmanship to cram an airline jam packed full of people in their first year. Simon you and all DEC’s are very welcome here, and in many ways add to the experience we have here, but it is appropriate that you respect that those of us who have watched the most dramatic dive in Pilot terms and conditions imaginable from within this company do know exactly how it happened here. Trust me, trust all of us who were here for the great downfall, Seniority will defend Pilots, simply because it is controlled by pilots. We need to get ourselves out of the woods before the next downturn, and we need to work together. Running a personal campaign against the ground we have delivered in a common direction here is only working to disintegrate what some of us collectively have literally put thousands of hours of research and slog into. We didn’t think this whole thing up on the back porch over a few cans.

[2018-10-22 16:31:18] <rvelthove> Already put up as an idea once to collectively and individually all approach this BOSS of a BOSS, and ask him to take over.. What if 1000+people from a company ask you to come in and be their boss, hoe would that feel? As well as the media attention it would get....?!   
[2018-10-22 16:43:19] <fourdonks> If I'm mid seniority then hopefully I can be considered reasonably impartial when I still say seniority is just wrong. I don't wish to be senior to anyone, I don't wish to be junior to anyone - I consider all my colleagues as equals. Do a year at BA and you'll see what a crazy aberration seniority is. (However LIFO is one of the few legitimate uses of it). 
[2018-10-22 16:47:38] <boston58730> After that memo a few guys checked with handlers at their respective home bases and reported back that they would not be taking care of anything regardless of what FR says. I don’t recall anyone coming back with a positive response. 
[2018-10-22 16:56:41] <ginosabatino> They wanted to use refusal to go into capt discretion and sick leave?! What the actual fuck. I heard that in ltn for the downsize last year, they used sickness and woffs. 

Seniority (lifo) is the fairest method 
[2018-10-22 16:56:50] <kilroyrobin> We are all equals you see, it’s like a queue for the bank machine. You take your place in the queue, you don’t jump it, you respect the people ahead of you because as your equals they also deserve to have their turn at the machine. The current system has a HR manager offering to shove the rest of the people in the queue out of the way for you if you’re nice to him and do something for free. That is not a game for you or your equal colleagues to play. It’s just not civilised, even with a fancy name like ‘meritocracy’.

[2018-10-22 17:21:29] <kilroyrobin> The matrix for selection in case of base downsizing that they presented included working WOFFS, discretion, sick days, and ‘other factors’.  
[2018-10-22 17:29:24] <coolhand787>  It is time for R O U N D A B O U T  with Paneuropean aspirations of all pilots concerned to RYR Management  
[2018-10-22 17:31:57] <coolhand787> Andy I think handling agent might help but knowing RYR the agent may end up out of pocket. And it is not for handling to patch up shortcomings of RYR. It’s a simple fact RYR refused to pay the 165€/night per crew for a decent accommodation. Instead they stayed in crew room later in VIP lounge. Certainly not EASA specific adequate rest facility! Another disgrace :face_vomiting::lying_face::lying_face:

[2018-10-22 17:47:12] <brendanjacobs> Simon I won’t argue with you on your views regarding seniority, everyone has an opinion and reasons for that opinion. The only thing I will say regarding your post above, why do you think management are going along with the idea of seniority? The answer is simple but not the answer you gave. Ryanair said that this was a completely unreasonable and unimplementable demand. They opposed it so strongly that they forced us to go on strike for 5 days in Dublin. Then when the rest of our colleagues joined us, it forced Ryanair into mediation, another thing they said they would not do. Once an independent person was let in on the ‘dispute’, suddenly all that was unreasonable turned out to be perfectly reasonable, all that was unimplementable turned out to be very easy, once the moron manager had it explained to them. The reason they are ‘going along’ with this thing that they made us fight tooth and nail for, is because this is something that is acceptable to most of the pilot body, 100% of the Irish based pilots that voted! They want everyone to believe that everything is hunky dory in Ryanair land and that’s why they’re NOW after 5 strikes, going along with it. This is not something they want, but it is a good news story if they get agreements signed.

[2018-10-22 21:32:55] <remco.spelt> As Maarten pointed out in an response on another channel we are still around 1100 slack members after 1 year with many leaving and new pilots coming.... How about we make an thread how to increase union membership/(active) slack members.
 I will start :
1. Print application forms for local union of country where you are based and hand them out to FO/Capt outside the crew room/cockpit (otherwise it might be seen as union propaganda by Ryanair)
2. Let's make an A4 factsheet why to join the unions in general and attach it to application form
3. Tell the non union member to think about it and get himself informed and hopefully then they will sign up (again we can't promote union membership to much as it is not allowed and Ryanair has been punishing people in the past for it)
4. Prepare an quick guide on how to use slack and spread in the whatsapp groups and encourage people to use it and check it on daily basis like many do with Facebook. Also explaining how to use during long turnaround/cruise is an option as part of slack can be used offline 

Anyone other ideas? I am willing to create quick guide to slack &amp; if someone else is willing to create an factsheet for union membership we can share it below and distribute it.... We need to go up in numbers... :reminder_ribbon: :point_up: :muscle: :flag-eu:

[2018-10-22 23:07:06] <remco.spelt> Once you load slack, you can read all the new comments, only thing is you can't put up a reaction. Was meant more as to show people new to it how to navigate thru it and show them where to find what and how....  
[2018-10-22 23:24:19] <mtscuddy> I think a big issue is there are 1.. A record number of new cadets/DECs in the company that need bringing up to speed with our long fight for basic rights as professional pilots/crews, 2.. There are many who fear saying no to management when they have a right to do so, 3.. Unfortunately some colleagues are still out for themselves offering all their month off to work days off for the company either for their greed or hoping for favours in return from the company. 4.. Those that do not have faith in unions, think they are too expensive or do not see the need to join. All these groups along with all of us on slack need to be educated to the same level and standards whether union members or not to create a real unity. (Apart from Slack for union members only) at present we do not have a website/resource to go to showing our true rights as employees/contractors of Ryanair. What about a website (or PDF file that we can store on our Ipads/phones) that is available to all Ryanair crew stating our rights for different scenarios that we have been discussing too often on slack such as, when they call you before a standby starts, when they change your duty start times when you check in, when they ask you to work a day off, when the crew tell you they are fatigued down route etc. If we had a private, very clear website/resource for all Ryanair crews (union members or not) hopefully we would all be using the same 'Checklist of Rights' and we would all know what is expected of us in different situations. Some are very frequent such as calling for WOFFers, others are less obvious such as being called in for a spontaneous disciplinary meeting with the BC/BS after a duty - whether that is acceptable and if you have the right to refuse or at least choose a witness, does this count as Duty Period after a day of work?etc. I think half the battle we have is we are still quite divided either through greed, through fear of management or even through the unknown of what is expected of us and what we have the right to say no to. Our rights need to be in a black and white, easy to access resource written by ourselves but information gathered from our contracts, manuals etc. There are many scenarios that we still do not know exactly where we stand so we agree to things we shouldn't and slowly we fall in to the trap of degrading our own terms and conditions..... Perhaps a resource written based purely on facts from our various contracts, Ops manual, FTLs etc could help unite us enormously not just as union members but for all the crew whether we have just started the Type Rating or amongst the most senior crew in the company. The 'Rough Guide To Ryanair' really is a rough guide, maybe its time we put together a specific guide listing our rights covering many different scenarios we have all had difficulty with in the past to make sure we do not collectively make the same mistakes again..

[2018-10-26 19:18:36] <brendanjacobs> I see they’ve put up the productivity bonus reminder memo. Unlike the WOFFers who’ve been working all year, I’m sure anyone who does volunteer the days, will not get to choose which duty they want to work. Hardly worth doing it for 6 days! I know people who are on the ‘deal’ for whatever reason have been pondering how best to go about choosing which days to put as available. Has anyone considered just not volunteering the days at all? From what I can see all you’ll be losing out on is the 1k in each of the months of Nov and Dec. After tax that’s only €480, that’s if based in Ireland. If it’s another euro country, with the higher social insurance it’s even less. F**k them, just don’t offer the days!

[2018-10-26 19:28:28] <peter.j.marriott> That was €1000/mth for 12 months for the 6 days. I was on that when I joined before changing over to a contractor.  
[2018-10-26 19:28:39] <andyappeltans> I have been given A/L days in both nov and dec so i don't see why i need to give up off days 
[2018-10-26 19:33:10] <rogierbrink> Same here! Won't offer any. 
[2018-10-26 19:44:55] <maassen.maik> Thank you Brendan, I had the same thought and shared it twice on slack, but I got no response or no interest. "What's the point?", "then you don't get the bonus" etc. 
[2018-10-26 19:48:00] <masterharkin> It’s not about money, €1,000 per month or €1,000,000 per month. It’s about respect not only for your colleagues in Ryanair but respect for your colleagues worldwide. I returned yesterday from a trip where I was lucky enough to talk to my colleagues from some of the biggest national carriers in the world. To my remorse they informed me that their terms and conditions have been eroded over the last decade thanks our weakness. I was shocked to discover that a number of the legacy airlines have their Pilots buy their own uniforms. Not long after this remorse I was lifted from the gutter by a Captain from a different airline that thanked me and requested that I thank all of the a Professional Ryanair Pilots for their courage, honour and bravery in trying to improve THE WORLD of aviation. Have no doubt that the world is not only watching you but relying on you. I will not disappoint them, will you?

[2018-10-26 19:48:11] <maassen.maik> Tons of new direct contracts were offered in Germany this year, because Germany is now officially contractor-free zone.
Potentially loads of flights could be cancelled if these days are not offered, but everyone I've talked to so far prefers the quick buck or is convinced it would not make a difference :rage: (edited)
[2018-10-26 20:02:04] <brendanjacobs> Pete the deal was that you would not receive the 1k for Nov and Dec only. You still got the other months regardless. And it’s also only supposed to be for this year that you have to offer. Bonus continues next year without having to give up days, unless you’re on the new Italian deal as far as I know 
[2018-10-26 20:04:58] <rednose> To offfer = to volunteer = to agree freely 
NOT!! 
[2018-10-26 20:11:22] <peter.j.marriott> Ok. I just thought it was ongoing. Not really bothered. One of the reasons I moved over to a contractor. Too many things in the RYR contract that can be taken away at will to RYR. Much easier to be in control of a set amount and handle my own affairs. 20 years and it’s hard to change.  
[2018-10-26 20:59:46] <padawa> Is that written down anywhere that it’s just Nov and Dec we lose on? That’s what I thought also but I’ve never actually seen it anywhere? Our bc also came out earlier this month that we don’t have to offer any days but just if they need us to work days off we should be accommodating???? :man-shrugging::skin-tone-3: 
[2018-10-26 22:29:43] <nilsholdrinet> I have the "bonus" set aside. They can have it if they want, I'm not offering OFF days. If they reopen EIN, BRE and not reduce NRN, GRO maybe I'll consider it. But otherwise they can go fly a kite.  
[2018-10-26 23:04:32] <biondina> I believe it’s like this. You give them the days in November and December and then you keep the bonus for next year. If you don’t you don’t get the bonus next year.  

---- 2018-10-27 ----
[2018-10-27 07:47:23] <kilroyrobin> It is correct that there are too many things that they can take away on this current contract. However transitioning to being a contractor which prohibits collective action is not a long term solution. Currently it accounts for a 50% chop in the collective strength of the FR pilot body. Every now and then a new contractor deal comes out too. This deal is accepted or refused individually, so its accepted whatever it is. I would urge all people to move on to an employee contract from where we can act together and fix it together rather than survive alone. Lone survivors have allowed FR to deliver a 50% reduction in basic pay in just 10 years. It is not about which contract is best now. It is about which contract can we all fix now. Employees may have less cash, but they have more rights. Currently there is a burden on employees to fix it for all. Nobody else can. With the 50% of pilots who now have rights as employees, and the 50% who don’t, we will be restricted to fighting in the good times and getting torn apart again in the next recession.

[2018-10-27 10:51:57] <mtscuddy> I wont be giving my off days up, but for anyone who is, Ops manual states not "as far as possible, not
selecting a crew member ON DAY ONE OF OFF DAYS. Crew control will also
review the subsequent duty block (5 days) to endeavour to have TWO local nights of rest OR MORE, but NEVER less than one local night PRIOR to the
commencement of the next duty assignment." I have a feeling they will try and get away with this where possible. (edited)

[2018-10-27 19:26:14] <tuhhodge> It is arguable in law that anyone who has accepted the productivity bonus over the last year is legally bound to offer the days. Legally, they are justified in asking for the money back if you don't offer the days or, knowingly this company, they'll just take it from your ongoing pay. However, I suspect nothing will happen to those who stand their ground.

[2018-10-28 05:17:05] <brendanjacobs> Tom can you post a copy of the agreement. What has been said in meetings and in memo’s is not what you are saying now. 
[2018-10-28 05:43:02] <tuhhodge> I don't have anything to hand, but I made my comments as simply a reflection of general English Law. You don't need to sign anything to enter into a contract. The basic principle is that if you accept money knowing full well that it is in exchange for you performing a task, you are bound to do it or repay the money if you fail to discharge your undertaking. 
[2018-10-28 05:52:23] <brendanjacobs> Except when they say, all you have to do is offer the days in Nov and Dec, if you don’t, you’ll ONLY lose out on the 1k in each of those months. That’s what was repeatedly said by EW at various ‘town halls’. The whole thing was completely ambiguous and one of the main reasons the majority of us still aren’t on that particular deal. Not a dig at anyone, some had no choice, some were advised it was fine etc

[2018-10-30 13:18:08] <padawa> 100% needs done now not later, it’s these reports that may change the tide of this behaviour in the future, remember when we had to all of a sudden call DR when we called sick, CHIRP reports followed by requests for answers by them as I believe is what stopped that!! Like had been said before, if there’s been no reports then everything must be fine then!

[2018-10-30 21:43:11] <ginosabatino> Some lads in FRA had a letter after 6 days. 

Its their tactic, each year reduce the threshold by a day, and the work force is too scared to go sick. Failing that, change their contract to make them pay 400e per sick day (ryanair sun) will sort it out. 

It has to stop!

[2018-10-31 06:20:15] <johnmurray737> Hello Justin. Just with the slack clean up you may want to fix your profile. You are just up as “Justin”  
[2018-10-31 11:15:27] <mmarshall_1993> Hey everyone, I have been chatting with the general manager at the Novotel STN, and I can confirm that it was not the Hotel or Ryanair that requested the rate to go up, it was Accommodation Plus International (API), without Ryanair really knowing that they were going to put them up. This will affect many hotels around the network. I've been given the contact details for our Ground Operations Manager Joanne Brady attached. Please can everyone pass her details around, and anyone that has been affected by this price rise anywhere please contact her directly to voice your concerns. If we can all get together we might be able to show Ryanair that they made a mistake in using API and it's costing Ryanair a lot more money.

Joanne Brady, +353 1 945 1337, <mailto:bradyjo@ryanair.com|bradyjo@ryanair.com>

I can't attach the file, it says there isn't enough storage left on Slack

[2018-10-31 11:24:47] <coolhand787> Thanks for heads up Mark! Maybe API is sick and tired of the RYR squeeze/kickbacks over their whole network of hotels so they just hike up prices! Remember RYR is always getting greedier! :face_vomiting::face_vomiting::face_vomiting: 
[2018-10-31 12:31:09] <mmarshall_1993> No worries. Could well be API trying to get there own back. Ryanair are not getting any of the extra money, the only one benefiting is API. Ryanair and us the pilots are paying a lot more money. (edited)
[2018-10-31 12:42:58] <remco.spelt> A pilot who gave up 2 blocks of 3 days for productivity had 3 days taken already and earlies/late disregarded to match the pattern....:thinking_face: 
[2018-10-31 13:06:40] <bkehoe00> The API rates are higher for hotels I’ve been booked in that one can get with former ryanair only rates or eg Hilton ‘AL’ rate in the case of EDI. They’re wasting a fortune on hotac on any OOB I’ve been on in the last few months.  
[2018-10-31 16:18:16] <jamsan90> Thanks Mark, do you think it is the same for Hampton Hilton as well? It is usually around 79-86gbp for a night at Hampton atm.

The key to a successful lie is to make it simple and keep saying it. Once you start to embellish it, you get found out pretty quickly! 
[2018-10-31 16:36:14] <brendanjacobs> This is how I interpret that. You are all so high on hours but we still have 2 months left in the year. We don’t really want to pay a load of pilots to sit around N/A HH or on standby but not useable so please apply for unpaid leave so we can save some money!

[2018-10-31 19:06:01] <boston58730> Makes sense that they would check load factor x yield and compare to fuel prices and take a decision. 
Off course the fact that there aren’t pilots of crew to actually fly doesn’t come into it.

[2018-10-31 20:53:20] <kilroyrobin> Its little short of insulting, but then when you see what Pilots actually signed in Poland it’s not one bit surprising they think we are thick as two short planks.  
[2018-10-31 22:38:58] <fergus.cassidy> They say one thing but it means something else. Reading between the lines I see it as we'll pretend we have spare crews by giving the option of unpaid leave when in reality there's not a hope of release. They made a mistake of saying predominately FO's. It's like putting up roadshows information on crewdock or crewroom pedestals. What do staff working for Ryanair want to know about roadshows for. It's to tell us we have loads of pilots when in reality there are none. The only guys who'll get unpaid leaves are those high on hours anyway. 
[2018-10-31 23:35:37] <robertwasilewski> This memo is ridiculous.. Why should someone who is high on hours apply for unpaid leave...if you high on hours you will get NA/HH paid leave..lol

[2018-11-01 17:46:29] <boswellbrown> Fantastic result. I’d expect HQ to come out fighting, but it does seem management are swimming against the general tide of public, legal and government court of opinion. The resources being wasted in doing this must be significant.  
[2018-11-01 18:09:04] <coolhand787> Serks this is a great document! Well done! Very much to the point. And as Justin just put it, a UNITED fight like in EIN shows how being a union member and having their total support to fight RYR in court brings huge benefits! UNITED BEFORE FLIGHT! Indeed! :muscle::clap:

[2018-11-02 08:26:35] <bertreinen> Dear all,
I need to vent my thougts as well...
Its now been one month since the anouncement of the base closures of EIN, BRE and the reduction of NRN. Since then, have we shown ANY UNITY to Ryanair? In my point of view everybody just stood there and did NOTHING and just let it happen. (Please, someone, PROVE ME WRONG!) In the mean time the bullying just continues, as you can read in the posts of my colleagues above. Why are unions still negotiating while all this is happening, right in front of us? I really start to question what the actual definition of UNITY means. I thought it was "All for one, and one for all". Am I right? 

Kind regards,

An Eindhoven Refugee

[2018-11-02 08:47:57] <boston58730> I don’t know why we, as a pilot body are standing for these closures. 

When I ask, I am told that plans are in the works and that due to agreements in place, sister unions cannot stand up until Christmas. All I can hope for is that when it comes, the action will be decisive.

I have said it before and I will say it again. If this move goes unanswered, no small base will support us in future. If we must stand for these closures now, full reinstatement of these bases and all staff must be achieved before any cessation of hostilities moving forward.

[2018-11-02 08:51:31] <boston58730> National MSL agreements are a big step forward for us but if the closures of these bases are not addressed, the company will clearly see our weakness and these agreements will be a Pyrrhic victory.

[2018-11-02 09:09:40] <robertgormley53> My guess is that as a collective pilot body, we don't have any unity ammunition until certain parts of the year are upon us. 
[2018-11-02 09:21:21] <kilroyrobin> Correct. Unity is one for all and all for one. However the realities of the national differences mean that seasons are important in those nations that don’t have the protection that you have in NL and Germany through the courts. This seasonal issue is one that I personally fought to the bone to avoid, but ultimately the complexities are such that the 10th of August came at the wrong end of summer. There is a whole lot more to it too, but the reality is that this is a weak time of year for industrial action compounded by various points being fought in different nations. It is just not as simple as saying everyone just stop now. We have to accept that national laws do not facilitate transnational action. We have to execute transnational efforts within the constraints of national laws as things are now.  It however is as simple as saying we need to regroup. Don’t confuse the weak season with weak unity.

[2018-11-02 14:22:23] <boston58730> Adam please do us all a favour and show the new BC how to operate the L1 door before you leave. That’s if this guy will have enough spare time to fly after all that arse he’s kissing. 
[2018-11-02 15:00:09] <damiano.detomassi> BC TXL for the summer was a new DEC , he did a very good job and very pilot oriented . Guess what ? Leaving the position . 
[2018-11-02 15:34:15] <boston58730> Interesting that the least experienced captains in Ryanair tend to be the BCs and the LTCs. That alone tells you everything you need to know about what this company places value on. 
They want fresh guys who can be leaned on hard and replaced at a moments notice.

[2018-11-02 18:05:23] <hrvojesucic> Not that I don’t think BCs are nodding their heads to whatever the company says, but why talk trash about him being recently upgraded? Have all you guys had left seat experience before being upgraded?

[2018-11-02 19:03:09] <andrewsawkins> Wow this time next week he might be a BC and a line trainer. But he still won’t have the hours for line checker :clown_face: 
[2018-11-02 20:27:14] <dohpau> To be fair to Pedro out in PDL he is the most experienced captain in the base once the current BC leaves and he's done the job before as an FO.

[2018-11-02 20:38:58] <boston58730> I don’t look down on new upgrades because they’re new. We were all new once. I am lamenting the fact that more experienced guys aren’t interested in the post because of the rubbish pay and conditions.

The nature of modern aviation means that all most of us have to show to prove ourselves is how many hours of incident free flying we have completed. Apart from the likes of Sully, the most action most of us will see in our careers is the odd in-flight shutdown, low speed RTO or IAS disagree. This is why when most airlines recruit pilots the requirements are expressed in flying hours. 
[2018-11-02 20:50:27] <sam.vanherzele> Think the BC SOF was base captain even before he started line training as DEC. 
(To be fair, he did work for ryr a couple of years ago).  
[2018-11-02 21:47:41] <boston58730> The problem with being BC or LTC without the hours is that the only advice you can give is to regurgitate the manuals rather than pass on your personal experiences. Again this is not the fault of the individuals concerned but a symptom of the system. 
Imagine if there was a company position of an agony aunt base FO who you could talk to in each base for guidance and advice, now imagine if that post holder still had less than 500 hours. He may still be the best guy for the job but it just wouldn’t sit right and I’m sure he would be much better once he had his 1500. In some bases like PDL there are no experienced guys so fair enough. This is not the case in WRO and many others.

[2018-11-03 00:35:46] <jolmervanbrakel> @boston58730 sorry but that statement is a syptom of the system in itself. You don't know what people might have done before starting flying and you don't know what experience they take with them, which could be well valuable in a training role or whatever position. 1000's of hours of sitting in the left or right seat does not make you a good pilot, a proper captain or a good person in general.. Useful experience is what you make of it and how you choose to use it..  
[2018-11-03 05:02:44] <boston58730> Agreed. There will always be an exception to the rule which is what the interview process is there for. 
I think Damiano has made the most insightful comment thus far. 
[2018-11-03 09:46:34] <coolhand787> Hey guys I think Hrvoje seems to think we are negative about DEFO becoming BC with upgrade in the same year! NO! You are missing the point, crucial factor that is RYR love to generate YES MEN, individuals who will bend over for the company and bend the rules to the company’s advantage! And by doing so potentially creating situations where we as professional pilots get put into a tight spot! F. Ex. 1.) Rest interruption calls by crew control are ‘legal’ yet the flight crew member is responsible to have adequate rest prior to his duties 2.) Departing on sector 3 when you knowingly go into Commanders Discretion for FORSEEABLE circumstances 3.) Taking multipled HIL’ed snags on an aircraft that this is no problem until you have to deal with it yourself 4.) Calling you off STBY on day 5 of your earlies shift and fly a late flight which is ‘legal’ because of the only 15h awake time taken from when your STBY started, and not when you actually woke up (which is definitely earlier). And I could go on for another while. If you try to oppose this DICTATURE =&gt; Disciplinary meeting in DUB assured! So we are fighting to stop the company appointed YES men who encourage this kind of behavior and attitude. The only result of this ‘rule bending’ for the company = company makes more money and a deterioration of our rights, our professional judgement and T&amp;C! So this is WHY RYANAIR MUST CHANGE!

However the hassle and the fact they will only accept expenses incurred at the airport immediately prior to duty mean everyone I know doesn't bother.

[2018-11-05 16:43:44] <brendanjacobs> That’s not what was said in meetings! 
[2018-11-05 16:47:12] <franciscofonseca93> That's what they've told me at least. Otherwise they wouldn't give you the money before making sure you would either offer the days or give the money back. 
[2018-11-05 17:04:21] <bkehoe00> What Francisco says is what we were told in GLA and was one of the reasons we rejected the first offer of the amendment. The only 'give' from their side was they said they'd allow someone to offer the days another month if Nov/Dec happened to be their month off and they had plans already.

[2018-11-09 19:50:33] <mmarshall_1993> Hey Everyone, just an update on the Novotel STN. The new proposal Joanne set me this evening is £57 per night. I believe this is still a bit too high. What do you guys think? What's the maximum you would pay? Also there's some contradictions in her email compared to what the GM told me. Which I will speak to him about next week.

Also anyone that also got the email from Joanne tonight regarding the rate, please reply with your thoughts. 
[2018-11-09 19:56:27] <remco.spelt> For the facilities you are getting it is a bit steep. For around 20 pound (if you can get the crew rate in Raddison) you could get a much better hotel next to the terminal… 
[2018-11-09 20:16:40] <mmarshall_1993> Yeah that's right.  
[2018-11-09 20:34:09] <andy.airamerica> £57 seems reasonable to me for the Novotel. I hope they’ve sorted out the issue of one bus driver in particular who refuses to stop at the sim center.  
[2018-11-09 20:53:47] <mmarshall_1993> £57 is reasonable I guess for the odd few nights a year for the sim, etc. But for people like me who use it as a second home for around 17 nights a month, it's still a bit too steep. I think so, From the hotel to the sim and from the sim to the hotel is fine, but anything else, is a no go.  
[2018-11-09 21:35:57] <rupertlamb> Thanks for looking into it, I think £57 sounds fair enough 
[2018-11-09 21:58:06] <ricardo.an.sousa> You can get it cheaper if you have an ACCOR membership. The company should be at least the same I would say. For people living permanently there, it's a bit steep now 
[2018-11-09 22:12:30] <sikokr> Too many pilots depend on this hotel. Think about cadets. For them 57-49=food for the day. Price should return to 49£.  By the way that new website for booking hotels <http://ryanair-contractors.apihotelexpress.com|ryanair-contractors.apihotelexpress.com> is a joke. All hotels I used are now more expensive. ALL :angry: Today saved 100€ by booking directly with the hotel in VNO.

[2018-11-10 07:16:54] <thomas> The most striking thing to me is the fact they want to get rid of the standby after and before days off and that they will have the ability to swap you from lates to earlies and vice versa. Are they really sure they have enough pilots?  
[2018-11-10 07:34:57] <hrvojesucic> If we don’t fly 900h MOL’s position is that pilots have not achieved a sufficient level of “productivity”. 
[2018-11-10 07:54:59] <hrvojesucic> Chris I agree. My thoughts were the same when I checked the prices using their website. I was mostly using it for DUB to stay in the Premier Inn in Swords, which used to be 43 EUR per night, then last year they increased it to 49, but since we can’t call the hotel anymore for the RYR rate, the price per night is on average 70-80 EUR (compared to 49!!!). I know Novotel STN is a more frequent place to stay due to the sim, but what Premier Inn did was disgraceful. There’s a load of us commuting to/from DUB, and we now have no choice but to faff with renting as Duncan suggests, but not even that is the solution for everyone (guys temporarily in DUB). Every hotel seems to be raising prices basically because of greed, and in the end the brilliant “economists” and “analysts” call it INFLATION. Bollocks! (edited)
[2018-11-10 08:40:14] <jamsan90> 57 is a bit too much I think for us who commute to Stansted. 50 sounds reasonable

It likens human systems to multiple slices of swiss cheese, stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are \"layered\" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of failure. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the University of Manchester, and has since gained widespread acceptance.  It is sometimes called the cumulative act effect.\nAlthough the Swiss cheese model is respected and considered to be a useful method of relating concepts, it has been subject to criticism that it is used too broadly, and without enough other models or support.","fallback":"wikipedia: Swiss cheese model","service_icon":"https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/bfaba\/img\/unfurl_icons\/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Swiss_cheese_model?wprov=sfti1"}] (edited)

[2018-11-12 09:27:50] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FE28HSW07 with text: While we are on the subject of remembrance on conflicts of old, meet Kenneth MacLeod of the Isle of Skye, taken between 31/12/1915 when he was promoted to Commander, the rank he held when he was the Navigating Officer of HMS Malaya, one of the Fast Battleship Squadron at the battle of Jutland in WW1, and 31/12/1921 when he was promoted to Captain. He is my great Grandfather, I’ve got his hooter alright, although I believe his one was largely removed by a shell before the war was over. After all that he died of pneumonia while still in his thirties, but a fighter and a Navigator still. The Irish half of my family and this guy might happily have shot each other, who knows, particularly my Grandfather who did the ‘Daily Dose’ for Eamon Devalera as his press secretary, but they all fought for their side, just as we do here. As I have often said, we can draw inspiration for our fight here from these soldiers because they show us how to fight together whilst reminding us that we will never die together like those others among my relatives that I remembered yesterday who never came home or who came home in pieces. Our fight is hard, but not that hard. Sometimes it’s dangerous, but not that dangerous. It takes its toll, a serious toll at times, but we take our toll too - and that matters much because for us it is much clearer exactly who’s side is right. Our side is right. Our fight is right.

Think how hard that was to do, the last person to be Chair of A Company Council in Ryanair was Martin Duffy and he was sacked. The last person to use crew room pigeon holes for Union literature was John goss, also sacked. Then the ever determined Jim Atkinson suggested a union to his cabin crew and he too was sacked, yet here 5 men put themselves forward against this wall of fire. Every other MA was lined up and ready to go too, and just as we promised we followed them out of the trench, but it’s like going to the moon, the first one is up first, and they deserve to be remembered. As always, after the event it is much harder to explain how dangerous it was, once they are out and they survive it suddenly seems as if there was not so much danger, but that is a view point borne of the change these men brought. 1 week later I went public too, well I couldn’t leave them stand alone could I, nor it would seem could the thousand other Pilots who followed them out and wrought change from the rock face that had pushed us all too far, for far too long. And so it began, for us. But let’s not forget, so it would end for others, first it was Miguel. He was sacked. So were the two Housmans in Germany, and most lately Olav Leeman. All 4 were Council members. There are two things I don’t believe in - coincidence and leprechauns. One thing I do believe in is people like those listed here.

He has no problem with signing you off as fatigued if that’s how you feel and will back you up if leaned on.
The report above is pretty much standard stuff about physical and mental health but the more you need to follow those guidelines, the less you think about them.

Ryanair are clearly happy to pay a little to tick the box that says they have a theoretical plan, it’s our job as union members to make sure they implement it and take the pressure off. A good start would be to call off these sick meetings. Ironic that this meeting was at a time when so many of us have been targeted.

[2018-11-19 11:07:11] <boston58730> The few seniority list criteria I have seen have said they are based on first day of ground school. 

I didn’t see how this was to be verified. 

May I suggest one method that honourable members send a screenshot from EFOS showing their first training sign off to a member of their MA CC (or their designated representative) for verification.

I have checked and can confirm that my old TOPCLASS records were transferred over to EFOS and would assume this is the case for all pilots.

I think the main thing would be that all MA use the same criteria and level of scrutiny in establishing seniority so that a MSL can be compiled.

[2018-11-19 12:52:56] <peter.j.marriott> How about a different approach. Why not ask the DECs what they would like to see? What they think is important and what would make them join and support a union. 

Most DECs like myself chose RYR, not the other way round. I can tell you from my own experiences over the last 20 years this is the easiest job and best roster I have ever had. I am not going anywhere soon. I would guess most other DECs are in the same boat. 

So instead of the “you must fall in and watch your place” which with most DECs will just piss them off and deter them, try and get them on board. Numbers are key to the success of the unions. 

 
[2018-11-19 13:10:25] <masterharkin> Nice approach Pete, 2 reds and 2 whites all the way in. I think you just gave yourself a job. Would you take it upon yourself to find out what the majority of DEC’s would like to see change. It’s only from feedback that Company Councils can make this a career airline for all.

[2018-11-20 19:52:16] <fergus.cassidy>  :christmas_tree: Xmas swaps  Xmas swaps

We are going to open up a message within each base for swaps at Xmas so OOB pilots can go home to be with their family. There will be a message for Captains and First Officers. 
Its won't be possible to do much until xmas week roster comes out but if anyone can be of assistance to cover so pilots who are rostered OOB can go home it would be a brilliant act if unity. Who ever knows when they may be in a similar situation!!!!!
Please only reply within the thread of each message to reduce the amount of messages produced. It will also make it easier to find who can help. This idea was thought of by Jessica Murphy to assist pilots out of base from EIN, BRE and NRN but if all pilots could use this it would make it easier to facilitate a swap. 
So if you think you could cover a day for a colleague before xmas please make your self known when the requests come in.


Thank you in advance for your help.

[2018-11-21 11:02:04] <kilroyrobin> I have noticed a few people stepping up around the network, new council members. These people are the secret to our future. Many who began a year ago are still fighting, some have stepped aside, and some are stepping up now and these people are the focal point of success. We must never miss the fundamental point that all we have achieved will be as nothing if the baton is not passed along. First we have to take back the ground we lost, but then we need to keep what we recover. As surely as night follows day a retreat will follow weakness. We are not only in sympathy with the Dutch but we are the dutch. We have built a dam and told the oceans of commerce that they will advance no further. We must hold the line, but it will not be held by someone else, it will be held by us, by all of us. Only from that mental standpoint can we advance.

SOME VERY GOOD NEWS FINALLY
more on <#CCK6095RC|ma_uil> channel

there is a motion to change italian “laws” in order for any carriers hiring local crews, to pay them at least equal to that prescribed by the national collective contract agreement (Alitalia contracts).

A message from UIL secretary general, Claudio Tarlazzi, concludes: "Everyone must understand that Italy is not a land of conquest, and that one cannot ignore the laws of our system and respect for the protection and rights of persons".

[2018-11-22 08:38:12] <rvelthove> What does anpac say?  Or they will make it their victory maybe...  
[2018-11-22 10:08:54] <oliver> Probably.

Just as a reference, at the first few meetings with the government they have not been even invited.

Once they did, Anpac’s (FiNTA) suggestion to the government to resolve aviation problems in Italy, was to tell them that the solution would be for the state social insurances, to take over the expenses now airlines have, while employees are sick.

I kid you not, 
their solution to italian aviation problems is to give airlines an expenses cut, so they could invest more....... what kind of reasoning is this, especially coming from a “workers” union......? 
Sound more in line with airline lobbyist. 
[2018-11-22 14:50:24] <fergus.cassidy> It will be up to the pilots within each base to organize their own swaps. It will just be a way to put a list if pilots who'd like to go home and hopefully get some volunteers to cover their flights subject to hours and rest periods, etc.. it is just one way to shop how slack RPA can be used in so many ways. Even after all negotiations with the company are complete hopefully this app will still be used as it provides so much support about OOB, transport, etc. 
[2018-11-22 19:17:38] <hnijenhuis> Hi everybody,

Together with two fellow colleagues, I am collecting money for Stichting Hoogvliegers. This fantastic Dutch foundation makes it possible for seriously ill and disabled children to experience a great adventure: be a pilot for one day in a real airplane.

A crowdfunding was set up to simplify the process of collecting money. Everyone who makes a donation will automatically enter in a draw to win a flight in a real Boeing 737 simulator (with a value of €150!), which is sponsored by Prosim4u.
Donate directly via the following link: 
<https://kadonation.nl/en/groupgift/show/436550957> 

Every donation, small or big, will allow for more seriously ill and disabled children to fulfil their “dream of flying”. All proceeds will go in full to charity.

Do you want to keep yourself updated about our crowdfunding? Like and follow us on facebook:
<http://www.facebook.com/pilotsforcharity|www.facebook.com/pilotsforcharity> or visit our website: <http://www.pilotsforcharity.com|www.pilotsforcharity.com>. Please share our message with family, friends and colleagues. 

We greatly appreciate your generosity!

[2018-11-25 09:45:31] <ronan.walsh22> Have a question to any of the London based crew. Is it possible/feasible to plan to divert into another London airport or should we be bringing extra fuel to go further? I know London is almost at capacity but is there anything written that they won’t accept us?  
[2018-11-25 10:34:55] <dohpau> There was (is?) a notam for Luton that it no longer accepts diversions. All the LIS-STN flights have had BHX or EMA as an alternative recently. 
[2018-11-25 11:02:03] <fergus.cassidy> The general rule is they can only accept a certain number of diversions up to stand capacity but if it's an emergency or minimum fuel they have to accept you. Speaking to one of the London controllers one night when the shite was hitting the fan and spreading far and wide. Lucky I had 1.6 ton extra. There were mayday calls to beat the band. Forecast cavok night with cat 111 conditions in the end with LGW runway closed due to a burst tyre. They still schedule the LTN alt, option sometimes. I change the plan then to reflect a feasible alt. 
[2018-11-25 11:46:28] <timkuijpers> I find it disgusting to read about these unjustified radar outages! Think of all the unnecessary delays.. :scream: 
[2018-11-25 12:15:29] <brendanjacobs> ‘Widespread disruption’ you can basically assume they will not accept you. Apparently. Haven’t seen it written anywhere but our BC used those words the other day. 
[2018-11-25 12:16:02] <robwatts99> Personally I think it's ridiculous that there is no atc fuel on flight plans into London. I generally take 15 minutes extra anyway. Then if any small doubt exists regarding a landing I plan on furthest alternate. Any bigger doubt I chase new flightplans with only 1london alternate and the rest further afield. As mentioned above London operates at capacity and to divert into stn/lgw/ltn could be near impossible with time available.  
[2018-11-25 14:25:13] <boston58730> It is possible and feasible to divert to other London airports. But as stated LTN will only accept traffic under a Mayday. LGW will accept traffic but if you divert there without Mayday expect a shit ton of track miles and very shitty ground handling. Also bear in mind that if the reason for the divert is that STN is US there will be a lot of you diverting and all London airports are close to capacity. Personally, if STN is looking foggy I plan to arrive over STN with 4000 kg. If it’s snow I aim for 5000kg. Never had any complaints. 
	:+1: tuhhodge
[2018-11-25 15:33:45] <sam.vanherzele> There is an e-mail from CP dated 27/07/2017, stating that you should always take 600kg extra when arriving in STN before 0900L. Email valid 'UFN'. I haven't received any further notice so always take the 600kg :grin:

[2018-11-25 16:06:29] <ronan.walsh22> ‘Adequate Aerodrome’ (ops man pg.8-31) if they are not available at the time they shouldn’t be on the flight plan. If we have to declare an emergency to land there then it’s not available. A relatively minor incident in       one airport could be extremely dangerous if all our flt plans have London alternates. Does anyone know what capacity the London airports are operating at? 
[2018-11-25 16:27:00] <boston58730> I haven’t seen LTN used as an alternate on FPLs for a while now. Most I’ve seen use EMA, LGW or BHX. 

<https://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/documents/s25058/Appendix%20-%20Airport%20Capacity%20in%20London.pdf> 
[2018-11-25 16:40:38] <fergus.cassidy> That's 2012 when the world was starting to recover from a recession. That capacity has been well has truly used up. That night in 2011 I mentioned had LGW runway closed, BHX closed due to a Learjet crash and LTN was full to diversions other than emergencies. It's a lot busier now.

we have more standby crews on one day than the total number of Air Lingus pilots.

[2018-11-26 20:46:14] <kilroyrobin> About a year ago I had to accompany a fellow Company Council member in to CHQ for a disciplinary meeting after a “Random Audit” had found something on him, even though neither us nor our lawyer could see it. I was picked off by a very senior manager for ‘conversation’ while I was there. Like most Dublin Pilots of a certain vintage I knew this individual quite well from the old White House day’s where we would pass one and other on a daily basis. I was now in a position to explain my actions in the council, and this I found extremely easy to do. As a trainer of some years I had a sincere problem with the 4 year employment cycle. The appalling inability of Ryanair to retain good Pilots had to be addressed. I had clear view of the difference between those Pilots who were brand new and those with experience that I checked on the line. This 4 year cycle meant we were keeping our Captains for as little as 1 year given that it takes 3 years to make an FO a Captain. I pointed out that our own SMS data confirmed that the first 12 months as a Captain carries a 20% chance of an incident. I explained that it is one thing to have a scattering of such new upgrades cradled within an experienced Pilot body, but quite another to generate an airline which is literally jammed packed full to the brim of such Captains who will only give us their most poisonous year. I stated that only an accountant could think that was acceptable. No pilot in good conscience could standby and watch this without considering themselves party to the crime whenever the logical and statistical conclusion of such a policy is ultimately reached. The answer I got? “All our Pilots as you know are signed off by our instructors at a standard of absolute proficiency”. It’s true this aspirational phrase is in the manuals. Now I knew why. Now I could see the blame game in all its filthy glory. ‘Absolute Proficiency’ means perfection, and if it does not then tell me why. So all our new cadets and Captains are perfect - well that might be legally a beautiful piece of prose, but with 12,000 plus hrs I still can only imagine perfection in the flight deck, neither have I ever witnessed it in the jump seat. As a matter of fact it is the full understanding and acceptance of human imperfection that has distinguished Pilots as so often being a better performing profession than virtually any other through the very same statistics and analysis that so clearly show our common weakness found  in our own inexperience . I was getting nowhere with my points so I turned to CIA and the incredible job those guys did when both engines where surging or failed as they tried to make their way through a few thousand birds, with windows covered in blood these Pilots achieved the impossible - and everybody lived. What, I asked, do you think would have been the outcome had we had two 101hr Pilots sat up there?... “You can’t make decisions based on outlying events” I was told. A stunning reply. I remain appalled, troubled and deeply motivated by this statement. ‘Outlying events’ define aviation, outlying events wrote the checklist, outlying events informed our entire ethos, outlying events involve a couple of hundred souls each time. For who among them is it an outlying event. No no, we are Pilots, we are not accountants. We are the difference, we it’s seems often are also the responsibility. Here in those occasional stray parts of our industry such as we now find ourselves in where conditions tumble into a carefully crafted free fall Pilots must take a stand. Our airmanship and our passengers demand that we hold the line, and so we will hold it even if it demands that we walk the line to do so. We are Pilots, the gold we carry upon our shoulders is not glamour or glory, it is a hard earned and somber mark of the responsibility we choose to carry. If needs must, even though it should not be so, we will carry it until those around us have been forced to carry their share. (edited)

[2018-11-26 23:25:16] <robwatts99> Management are bean counters who will say that statistically there won't be any drama on any said day therefore high experience isn't required. I say the same about experience on an average calm cavok day, high experience is not essential. Unfortunately management don't consider days like southwest had last summer. Experience got that aircraft on the ground. To consider those days costs money. They play with people's lives for some extra €€€€ and on a day something may go wrong they will through that famous line out there to lay blame at our feet :pensive:

[2018-11-29 04:43:49] <robwatts99> I just read the compulsory read document regarding cabin crew fatigue report. Anybody else see it as a thinly veiled pressure to not call fatigued?  
[2018-11-29 05:21:42] <sam.vanherzele> I filed a fatigue report couple of days ago and got a nice talk with Gerry over the phone to discuss it. 
Unfortunately, other guys in my base are less lucky and are invited for 'the talk' in dub with a manager (who's not pilot or crew) to tell them fatigue is impossible on 5/4.  
[2018-11-29 08:15:15] <swfmcmanus> Sure we all enjoy a benign roster and 14 days off in the last 28 days. And our hours are all less than 96 per month. Not factoring in sim with some of the months. All legal and intimidation.  
[2018-11-29 09:43:41] <damiano.detomassi> I personally see it as a formalizing of a very dark process . They are putting it in a more standardized way and letting us know . The only concern I have is who decides if it’s “reasonable “.

[2018-11-29 09:59:22] <tomflood737> At a recent Negotiations Seminar that I attended, before the course started we were asked to pick a postcard from a 100 odd postcards scattered on a table. 

During the stage where we all introduce ourselves, we were asked to explain why we picked our individual postcards. As I was third off the bat, I had to come up with a reason pretty quick, as I just picked the postcard without giving it too much thought. As I looked closer at the individuals I noticed one had his hands over his eyes, and another over his ears and the third has his hands over his mouth. At this point I was glad I didn’t pick one of a racing car etc. 

I wonder who these three deadbeats could be.

I didn’t even see the memo about the ad hoc being open for Jan to Mar. I decided to have a read of the criteria for what should be considered a ‘compulsory read’, PB’s memo’s certainly do not meet the criteria. However, at the discretion of the CP, other memo’s can be compulsory reads. I guess it’s Rays fault then that we’re being subjected to this shit!

[2018-12-01 12:17:46] <hrvojesucic> Question for recent upgrades and everyone in the know: can we refuse the CU bonuses? Ryr claims that we get “15.000 EUR” (3 CU phases x 5.000 EUR) plus an additional 5.000 EUR for appointment as commanders. Is it possible to refuse these? Out of these 20.000 EUR that they claim we “receive”, we actually get 60% of it, but they bond you for the full amount. My logic: If I tell you that you’ll get 20.000 from me, you’d probably expect that I’ll give you 20.000, and not almost half of it.  
[2018-12-01 12:21:42] <oliver> In the meantime I am constantly called to DUB for having been sick....
They have no intention of keeping their own talent, in the meantime they go overboard in looking for replacements. 
[2018-12-01 12:49:11] <brendanjacobs> You’re 100% right there Hrvoje. If you intend on leaving within 2 or 3 years of completing the upgrade, don’t take the money! It’ll end up costing you. They said in negotiation meetings ‘sure they don’t have to take it if they don’t want to’. 
[2018-12-01 13:02:37] <boston58730> Not possible I’m afraid. If you use it to go short on FR shares though you should come out ahead.  
[2018-12-01 19:41:15] <arnaud2cagny> I need a good back tyre for a CBR any good deals Around? 
[2018-12-01 21:45:31] <dieter.vanheymbeeck> The amount you would have to pay back is 15k. 
You will receive 5k training bonus the month following groundschool to cover training expenses, and another 15k the month after you receive your letter of appointment. 
The bond is only to ‘cover’ the last CU bonus.
The bond will also reduce every year by 1/3th.
(Eg. If you resign within 2 years you would need to reimburse 10k) 
Then there is a transition system in place for those who were on the old CU system where you received €10/sbh as senior f/o for one year prior to the upgrade.
In this case the total bond is 15k minus the accumulated €10/sbh that was accumulated during the previous ‘CU bonus system’.
(Eg. You earned 700hrs on the old system, which is 7k. Then the bonus would be 8k and the 1/3th rule with regard to the three year bond applies on the 8k) 
The unfair part about this system is indeed the fact that they bond you for the full amount rather than the amount you receive after taxes.
This was in the what happened in my case.
I don’t know if they do exceptions if you ask. But the right man to ask would be Damian Guitton who is responsible for everything with regards to the upgrade. He usually helps out really well with all my queries. You can email him and ask! (<mailto:guittond@ryanair.com|guittond@ryanair.com>)

 
[2018-12-01 21:56:00] <tuhhodge> Still a lot better than the €0 per hour uplift as FOs on the RTC, the €0 CU bonus, the -10% salary decrease in first year as a Captain, and zero base choice we got.  
	:100: oliver, boston58730, cianmurray
[2018-12-01 22:23:07] <dieter.vanheymbeeck> True, even though the tax is not calculated for, after the interview i knew when i started my groundschool, where i was going to do line training and what base i was going to get. Also, the accomodation for you first 100 hrs will be provided if you do them out of another base. So I must admit that doing the upgrade is with a bigger peace of mind nowadays.
Offcourse, they only started treating the CU pilots better because they needed us so desperately! :sweat_smile: 
[2018-12-01 23:05:14] <ginosabatino> I am down 175hrs this year due to the upgrade, thats 15k...pretty certain thats how they came up with the figures! Its not a “bonus” its money that covers lost wages.

Take it, its money you would have earned anyway, you will need it to pay for hotels! And who knows, its unlikely to be able to move as a capt before year 3 anyway, so the bond wont be an issue 

---- 2018-12-02 ----
[2018-12-02 06:05:26] <tuhhodge> Very true Gino. On top of the CU 'fine' we got, the whole process leads to at least a month of no pay when you're on a 'pay as you fly' contract like we were. All that groundschool, SIM and waiting around for 100 hours and new base to start leads to a small fortune in lost wages. :open_mouth:

[2018-12-02 06:47:01] <brendanjacobs> It’s really no different to any joining bonus bond in any company. If you’re staying here for 3 years after upgrades, take it. Better than I got anyway. It’s still not how this should be done though! You should be paid whilst doing your training with accommodation and transport arranged and paid for by the company. Not paid a bonus to compensate for the loss in earnings. They’re doing it this way because it’s a fixed sum that they can easily work into their projected costs. Doing it this way also means it’s easy to remove at a later stage should the shortage of captains situation improve. It’s better than it was, but don’t take it as the company doing you a favour and trying to be nice! They’re trying to bribe people into doing the command pure and simple.

[2018-12-02 09:16:15] <sam.vanherzele> Due security laws, it's impossible to have a bag which is not assigned to a ticket. 
Some airports require you to have a boarding pass to get through security, but I always got a handwritten one, so not actually registered ticket...
Best guess would be to send a query and get a (free) stby ticket with bag included. I know of guys in EMA that got this as EMA security does not let anything bigger than carry on through their scanner.  
[2018-12-02 09:25:01] <masterharkin> I have to share a little story that involves you all. I have had the privilege of late to represent you in some international aviation conferences. One in particular that lasted three days but day one will stay with me until I die.

The conference room was huge not unlike the EU one in Brussels. Every airline in the world was there not just Europe.
Unfortunately I was in seat two and as such was the second to speak. I had the daunting task of pressing the button that lights up your microphone red and “your live” to your peers from every airline in the world. As soon as I said that I was Ryanair Pilot my talking was brought to an abrupt end as the whole conference hall broke out in a round of applause. This applause was not for me as I had barely opened my mouth. It was a sign of worldwide appreciation for what *you guys* are achieving in an attempt to fix what was once an admired and respected industry. Make no mistake about it, we are changing the world of aviation. 

When we opened our toolbox in September 2017 we had but only one tool. Today we have many tools but I still keep going back to my favourite tool. The one I know will never let me down. The one tool that I can use on every job and it will always give me exactly the result I need. That tool is UNITY. Trust your Company Council. There is ALWAYS a plan :wink:.

[2018-12-02 10:01:06] <johnfaessel> Thanks guys, will send a query and wait for an answer.  
[2018-12-02 10:08:19] <timkuijpers> All bonds should be deducted from your gross salery. So if you plan on serving your 3 months notice it should be no problem. This is what Darmuid Rogers told me when I told him I didn't want to sign for any bonus or new deal. (Of course we all know his word is worth f#ck all) Nevertheless I never signed anything but after 3 months I found 15k extra on my payslip. So without me signing anything I'm not planning on giving anything back..

Better would be to make things worth staying and not having to pay back anything because we are all happily enjoying our CLA's! :muscle: 
[2018-12-02 10:11:39] <fergus.cassidy> This shows just how much attention the Ryanair movement has gained around the world. We've gone from a pariah to a patron and while it's taking time it's been done properly with a lot of foresight for a better future for all.  
[2018-12-02 10:25:19] <robertgormley53> My experience is it depends on the airport and ground handlers. In my old base we could. In my current base we can't. 
[2018-12-02 10:30:17] <remco.spelt> Amazing news. Great to hear and thanks for sharing!  
[2018-12-02 10:33:14] <coolhand787> Absolutely Andy but check in the latest OM A entry requirements they have been reviewed! The race to the bottom continues! Accidents waiting to happen! Not surprised by rushed checklists/procedures (where RYR actively hides the truth) LOCI, FL 10 takeoff no V Speeds FL extended above FL 200 etc. It’s just a requirement to fill holes whilst ticking the boxes with the blessing of the IAA! i.e. CPT at any costs! Pure Management blatant ignorance of safety in favour of greed and money! I am afraid it’s going to bite them hard soon!  
[2018-12-02 10:36:51] <coolhand787> Bravo :clap:Stephen thanks for sharing this goose bump experience! UNITED WE STAND! Ryanair MUST CHANGE! And yes the whole aviation industry is following Ryanair’s until 2017 bad example of the race to the bottom! Race we all have U turned! UNITED WE FIGHT! (edited)
[2018-12-02 10:45:17] <tuhhodge> The law doesn't work like that. If you knowingly take money you know you're not legally entitled to, you either give it back if requested or you are deemed to tacitly accept the terms.  
[2018-12-02 11:07:20] <timkuijpers> Well, I also happen to record my calls for quality and training purposes and mr Rogers' smoothtalk is on there as well. Stating it is a bonus and not a bond.. Then that's how I'll treat it.  
	:joy: felix.bamesreiter, cianmurray, maassen.maik, mischa_buijs
[2018-12-02 11:24:44] <vcordido> I had this problem in DUB a couple of weeks ago, I was jumpseating and I didn’t have a ticket so they couldn’t associate the bag to it, so I had to take it with me as cabin bag. A few days ago I flew from DUb again, this time on a duty travel ticket and I could check it in. So if you can get the duty travel it’s better. Hope it helps 
[2018-12-02 11:29:04] <henry.lidster> What have the upgrade requirements been changed to now?  
[2018-12-02 12:47:11] <rvelthove> Thanks for sharing!   Moral boost in dark days 
[2018-12-02 14:28:53] <oliver_ohl> :+1::+1::+1::+1::+1: 
[2018-12-02 15:08:27] <kilroyrobin> All of you with the same reactions as myself..”Pariah to Patron”, “thank you for sharing”, “goosebumps moment”, and even from those who paid dearest for this respect “moral boost in Dark days”. We all understand here what it is we need to do. We all understood the risks going in to this, but we accepted them on a level of good conscience and responsibility to ourselves and our profession. Thank you for this great report and marker of the change and strength we have hammered and wrought from the furnace.  
[2018-12-02 17:27:06] <marjus1> Awesome. Well done. I’m clapping here too.  

---- 2018-12-03 ----
[2018-12-03 11:04:10] <hrvojesucic> I personally don’t mind receiving a bonus as long as it makes sense. But receiving 10k and having to return 20 (or whatever) is bs if you ask me. I don’t have plans for leaving, at least not for now, but if I decide to do so, I want to know in advance what I am going to be up against. Tim: I understand the 3x5000 plus 5000 appointment bonus, but what about those 6000 (more or less) for “cost of upgrade” they bond you with?  
[2018-12-03 14:04:51] <timkuijpers> Normal way to pay back a bond or bonus is via gross income. They withold it from your salery. So the tax losses (which was my concern as well) should be kept to a minimum. Talking to a financial advisor it seems that this is a normal way of doing so. Now I have those conversations recorded, but in any courtcase this probably wont be valid evidence. So best thing would be an email or query. (And for the record I didn't receive full 15k as I already had some of the 10,- psbh as an FO) I still figure it's worth to take it. If you stay only a year you AND they screw you over tax, the damage won't be that big anymore right?

[2018-12-04 09:36:52] <hnijenhuis> Does anyone know if we can jumpseat on LDM flights operated by their Airbus fleet? 
[2018-12-04 09:45:18] <robertgormley53> I read that you can, yes  
[2018-12-04 09:52:04] <felix.bamesreiter> I queried that to Diarmuid Rogers recently and he said currently it's not possible and there will be a crewdock memo if it changes  
[2018-12-04 10:57:45] <m_elderfield> Hey, few cabin crew in GDN are asking me if anyone knows a good Irish lawyer to help them with their situation over Ryanair Sun. Basically they need someone who has expertise in Irish labour law to help them over their current Irish Ryanair contracts. Thanks  
[2018-12-04 11:15:13] <johnmurray737> Who’s paying for it ? It could be very expensive.  
[2018-12-04 12:03:15] <masterharkin> Mike I think there is an existing Cabincrew Union in Poland. If they are a member of their Union then they should direct that question to their Union. Are they a member of their Union? 
[2018-12-04 12:23:35] <maciejmeller1985> The union in Poland has fallen as to many CC sign new agreement. There is about 50 or so who wants to keep up the fight. 
[2018-12-04 13:14:49] <adamtruran> Mike, contact me on WhatsApp  
[2018-12-04 14:09:33] <tyronebloem> I just heard from a friend in Norwegian it is not going great there. They just heard from the management that they have to save money, further no info. Application for DEC and FO 737 disappeared on there website, only for Argentina is on there. Also no DEC CPT or Relief Command positions open anymore for 78 on the moment. Only FO positions 78 via Rishworthaviation. Hopefully they will survive.:muscle: 
[2018-12-04 14:18:38] <boston58730> Well they can’t blame the fuel price anymore. If the worst comes true they will sold to IAG. Not such a bad fate. 
[2018-12-04 14:27:36] <boston58730> Now we have Ryanair Poland, Austria and UK. Who wants to take bets on where will be next. I think with the complete capitulation of ANPAC they won’t even bother with Italy and Ryanair France will be launched with the opening of any new base.

Just because the company is hiding behind franchises and subsidiaries we should not allow ourselves to be distracted, divided and crushed. Unlike the pathetic regulators we know who is the driving force behind all that is dark and evil in this industry.

[2018-12-04 14:33:39] <boston58730> Just an observer here but from what I have seen BA do in the past I doubt that would matter too much. The steps are simple.

Buy out, corrupt, or bankrupt the competition at all costs.
Maintain the monopoly over UK long haul.
Cut costs.
Increase Prices.

What they did against Laker (bankrupt), BMI, Virgin (corrupt), and Air Lingus.

[2018-12-05 20:17:38] <oliver> It is so sad to see how they treat these poor girls. 
[2018-12-05 20:26:01] <owencomiskey> And how they just treated you Oliver is also appalling.  So going sick is now breach of contract? WTF?  
[2018-12-05 20:37:19] <oliver> Yep, they always look for some pattern.... and I told them that is not correct. I followed procedures, and truly, if you look for patterns, you will always find them, even if there are none or are a simple coincidence.

If is the beginning of the week it is bad, they think you wanted a longer weekend, if it is in the middle, its still your fault, they assume you wanted a day off to relax (btw I commute so that makes no sense), if it is at the end of your shift, they assume again you want to start your off days earlier.

So they give me full responsability to fly almost 800 people around any work day, with good and bad weather, but they dont trust me with my sickness days or dont believe my doctors certification?

I am not an untrustworthy person that wants to stay home and have fun, paid by my employer, I am a professional and as such have an immense responsability on my shoulders, like any other pilot in the World. 
We risk our own life, our own licence and our jobs, in person, not sitting behind a desk looking at numbers and trying to see “patterns”.

We do guarantee such safety in aviation, by  continuosly choosing the best action to resolve the daily issues, and one of these are to say no when we are sick, unable to go on discretion or feel fatigued..... even if we are within the boundaries of our regulations.

So, yes I feel frustrated seeing people that have never been in our shoes, not believing in our professionalism. (edited)

I stood at the back of a cave looking into the light wondering how much of this I had missed while trying to bring things into the light. I thought of Tom Flood and Enda Ryan, and many others - but not that many - who still graft and graft and graft at this. Still sacrifice this part of life, nearly all of it. Can I rationalise with the 14 months of this I missed? Yes I can, because we did get Ryanair out of the dark, but people will need to understand that to a man, and to a woman, we who want change here need to do that change, be the change, all of us. Walking roundabouts is only the tip of an iceberg of work, that alone is not enough. Ask not what your Union can do for you but what you can do for your Union. Find your own place and piece to play in this army of combined efforts. We the people who see the need for change are the Coffee beans in the Jar, even as a minority ingredient we have already proved that we can turn the whole cup from plain old water to a damn good Coffee. If we want that Coffee strong we will all have to pile in. It’s early in the day, brew it black, brew it strong and stir it up to hell. Standing here I would be unwise to forget my Cave is tidal, my view of the light, even  our escape cannot always be had. When the rise and fall of life and tide returns we better be done in here or it’ll get messy and we’ll want for more than Coffee if we don’t get out and done first. Just ask the streams of Cabin Crew queueing up for their terminations in HQ right now, there is still more dark than light in my view right now, and the dark is black as hell.

[2018-12-06 15:52:05] <coolhand787> Rob I totally agree with you, it seems the Training Dept is sticking its head in the sand too! Sad to hear but this is just the tip of the iceberg, as not all ‘events’ are revealed to us, except the odd one on RH side of Crewdock. That reminds me of a discussion I head with a very high ranking Training Chief, where I stated that the EIN false G/S incident was a lack of situational awareness hand flying skills cos A/P was engaged right to a few kts from unrecoverable stall. The answer from the top man: “No they just did not recognize the threat of 9Deg G/S interception! My jaw dropped in astonishment! AGB :thinking_face: Mmmh

[2018-12-06 16:00:47] <robwatts99> Training dept will always just look for a breach of SOP to justify laying blame at the pilots feet but the shortcomings of the company stretch far beyond. Consider an FO in the canaries. 300 days work and 150 landings in a limited number of airfields can provide the minimum command experience required. Then 4 weeks into life in the left seat they sent to MRS or NCE which are very non standard fields. On paper the guy is ready. In real life? This is said with no disrespect to anybody but just an observation as to how minimal the required level of experience can be.

[2018-12-06 17:08:16] <coolhand787> Rob I see your point and agree. The RYR network allows for a varied amount of experience. No disrespect at all! The same goes for Winter Ops, some pilots will never have seen a real winter or winter ops depending where they are based. This is why I see the Winter Ops manual has been fortunately been severely updated and become more restrictive. However, and there you hit the nail on the head is the blame game in RYR. It is always the crew’s fault! Period! I have been there and defended my case tooth and nail! 2 ‘events’ Where Systems malfunctions but no documentation/assistance from company to assist. And no feedback that I was right. This has to do with liability and money! If it’s the crews fault and things get bad, Ryr can turn around and try to shake off responsibility to crew hence not paying! Like in EU261 scandal. Therefore SLACK is great for info sharing, and a good union backing who sees through RYR’s ‘blame game’! Being courteous to crews and seeing the company’s responsibility in events is also what must change in RYR!

[2018-12-07 18:48:57] <oliver> Thanks Alberto, Robin and Daniel.
It was about six days the first time, now a couple more. 

What I told them was also that I had no A/L from march til november, with whole summer sporting extreme rosters, bringing me, for the first time ever,  to have to declare three times in a row captaim discretion (day1 discretion, 2 out of hours, 3 discretion, 4 out of hours, 5 discretion, day6-first off wasted after 15 hour duty previous day.
That the magic NASA designed 4 days off, might still bring you into a state of accumulative stress/tiredness, that will eventually degenerate into a possible fever or other sickness producing phenomena.

Not sure they wanted to hear that. 
[2018-12-07 20:48:20] <thomas> That CDA below FL100 is such incredible nonsense. Anyone who flies to places like DUB, STN, LGW, AMS, FRA is toast by default.

[2018-12-07 23:23:27] <coolhand787> General question on POSI, what is the legality for obtaining the data in the first place? If OFDM, then this is supposed to be separate data set which is NOT controlled by RYR. As per OFDM protocol the cpt involved needs to give his/her consent to release data! Here system abused OFDM data used for POSI? Can anyone fill us in on the legality of obtaining the data in the first place.

[2018-12-08 13:53:28] <oliver> Thanks Thomas, 
am waiting to see how DUB reacts than I might have to respond.
The union (UIL) is there to backme and any other pilot up.

I actually feel bad for any Anpac pilot, who really needs the union to defend them possibly against rhe company....

[2018-12-08 18:47:45] <derekfdoyle> Years ago in Dublin one captain refused to use an annual leave day for Christmas Day and asked to be put on standby. They called him off standby to help the engineers. He spent Christmas Day moving aircraft around Dublin airport, in and out of hangars and releasing and setting parking brakes. He never  asked for standby duty again :joy:

[2018-12-08 19:18:51] <kilroyrobin> It’s a sign of how things were for so long that people would be expected to freely offer Christmas day up without any incentive other than just to get in ‘the good books’. You can see evidence in this document of why they had such a toxic initial reaction to a system which is seen elsewhere as fair and healthy. The fair and transparent seniority system when finally implemented should stop that fear of ‘the bad books’ on which the senseless expectation in this letter is entirely built.

[2018-12-08 23:45:46] <kilroyrobin> Yes. The First time I applied there were 17 applications in Dublin alone for two places. Kevin Mara and Tom Flood made the grade, and both won it fair and square through proficiency and experience. In the end I was secretly relieved not to have got it as I had only had my command 4 or 5 years which didn’t seem enough for such responsibility to both student and passengers alike in my own mind. Later, when I was successful, I knew I had enough of my own experience and indeed my own mistakes to give a student some good honest and hard earned heart felt instruction. I’ve never been much for teaching them what is the latest thing to do with the landing lights, but I can teach them to fly it, land it, mind it, mind the passengers, and mind each other.

[2018-12-10 10:00:03] <remco.spelt> I believe you can get them free of delivery charge if you don´t have 1 or
If you have an old one (more then 3 years old) subject to tear and wear (whatever that might mean) you can get the new one for free but you have to pay delivery…

then again I might be wrong, it is written in Ryanair language, like Ryanair math totally unpredictable 
[2018-12-10 10:04:36] <pilot> Exactly, I have one older than 3years, but I don’t know how to order one while paying only the delivery and not the coat “iaw. with the DFSCP memo” :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 
[2018-12-10 10:16:01] <howard.denis> I believe they are doing a ‘run’ in January, to me this is the free ones will be available to order FOC sometime in January when we have sorted all BC and people that ‘help’ the company! When it comes down the line when it’s your turn there will be none available until 2030 but you could have an option to busy one for £300 
[2018-12-10 10:18:09] <pilot> It says “the first PRODUCTION RUN is available in early january”, that means they are being made now and the first batch ready in jan.

[2018-12-10 11:25:32] <kilroyrobin> M.V. Excelsior was not such a glamorous vessel, but all in all she was huge. When I was 17 I was onboard this dry bulk carrier in Chesapeake bay, Norfolk Virginia. We loaded 130,000tonnes of industrial grade coal for South Korea, which was to be a 7 and a half week passage, with half of it on one heading. Industrial coal is just dust, so it is messy. We sealed off all the accommodation vents with tape, covered the hallways in paper and taped it down, but still the stuff just gets everywhere. It does not help that it is just poured into the ship so the whole thing is covered in a quarter inch thick layer of the stuff when you set sail.

There is slight arrogance in naval ships in the way they might perceive a right of way over a lowly merchant man, even while the laws of the land or seamanship might dictate a different interpretation. Presumably this is borne of the arsenal of weapons on deck for all to see. Our route to the open sea was along a narrow channel past the naval vessels of the mighty Atlantic fleet of the US Navy. Vast aircraft carriers, one after another, the JFK I remember was there, battleships, destroyers and all classes of ship, probably 50 of them. We slowly made our way along the sea way under minimum steerage so as not to break the mooring lines of these ships as our 1000feet of steel and coal powered by to the thumping tune of a slow and massive diesel. Skilfully and patiently our ship was piloted along as the single 29 foot propellor churned up the mud in the only deep that channel could offer. On the bridge there was some concern from a squall that was bearing down on us as well.

There was quite a commotion then when a US Marine small aircraft carrier littered with jump jets and helicopters suddenly began to pull out in the channel ahead of us. With 130,000 tonnes of coal onboard, we were not going to stop whether we tried to or not. Big ships have big whistles. These things were so loud they would rattle your shirt at 200 yards, and ours was blasting almost constantly issuing the short blasts that in the language of the sea mean what the hell are you doing?

The US Marines would not be accustomed to surrender, but they had to pull back out of the way for us - along with our vast and blackened mass. We were in our boiler suits and hard hats. The Marines lined the deck as you see ships do before a deployment, all in their pristine white uniforms. I remember thinking that it was most un-gentlemanly when we came in range of them and could hear their verbal abuse being hurled from the after deck, and this was accompanied by the 'one fist in the elbow, one in the air, international F^@K you' symbol from a good number of them.

Just at this point the Squall hit with a vengeance, it tore in with a howling breeze and lifted virtually all the coal dust from our decks. The Marines were down wind of us. You could hardly even see them through the coal cloud, or their white uniforms for that matter. For our part it was nice to have the ship cleaned up and ship shape ready for Sea with such little effort. On the Bridge Captain Taylor turned to the harbour Pilot. "Bloody Hells Bells” he said. “Might is right", the Pilot replied. "Might is right", don't any of the the four and a half thousand of us ever forget that fact!! (edited)

Puts my 3 years of waiting to get back to STN after upgrade into perspective. Somebody buy that man a drink, and find us a good sized :o:.

That’s all I want for Christmas.

[2018-12-11 08:39:33] <marjus1> What’s more frustrating is that he may have been passed over at some point in the past by someone junior ( who’s not to blame btw).  Similar stories everywhere. The old system was far worse.  Transfers to smaller bases will always have longer waiting times than larger I guess. Hope it works out for him soon.  
[2018-12-11 08:46:23] <boston58730> Taking bets on which one he gets first. 
ORK or Pension.

[2018-12-11 14:14:48] <boston58730> Carl I suggest you write a letter to Leo Varadkar. Tell him you have been waiting for a transfer to Cork since Brian Cowen was Taoiseach. At the very least they could rename the airport to Carl Horgan International. 

You never know, if you get enough momentum and publicity, you could end up being beautified as the saint of patience. Just don’t mention you want a transfer there from AGP though, you could lose your medical on psychiatric grounds.

[2018-12-11 18:55:27] <brendanjacobs> I have no idea what he is saying there. What he has confirmed though (which we already knew) is that a MMM IS a standby. That line crew control keep spouting, due to ‘an email from D Ryan’ that it’s a duty not a standby is in fact shite talk for, we’re in breach of the base agreement but we’re now going to try and confuse you to the point that your head starts to hurt and you have no choice but to simply hang up and go lie down for a bit. 
[2018-12-11 19:08:40] <robertwasilewski> This has been already for years and as far I know not many people can explain the difference between MMM and a STBY there is always a vague description confusing people even more. Those and all other roster abbreviations should be clearly explained in the OM A. 
[2018-12-11 19:44:40] <iglehane> Pile of crap again. It’s either a STBY or not. MMM should not be put on the roster (edited)
[2018-12-11 19:46:35] <boston58730> They use that code at bases where they have an agreement not to roster STBY on day 1 and 5. D Ryan told me that since it wasn’t a STBY, no agreements had been breached. 
[2018-12-11 19:48:39] <bkehoe00> Yeah Robert, but what's changed now is the previous memos all said they were 8 hour SBY. Now its suddenly become 12! 
[2018-12-11 20:12:36] <brendanjacobs> Ops Part A: 7.2.25 Standby means a *pre-notified and defined period of time* during which a crew member is required by the operator to be available to receive an assignment for a flight, positioning or other duty without an intervening rest period.

7.14 Home Standby - *Rostered, with start and end times defined*, ideally 14 days in advance. ......Crew members are considered to be on standby from the *rostered start time to end time* unless a FDP is assigned or Ryanair removes the crew member from Standby.

Nothing in there that says whatever it is Bernard was trying to say. If you haven’t been notified of a change to your duty PRIOR to the commencement of the rest period preceding that duty, you can only assume that your rostered duty stands. It says they can REDUCE the length of the rostered standby once it has commenced, but nothing about extending it by 4 hrs! Fucking chancers! (edited)

[2018-12-11 21:13:17] <marjus1> Poorly written. A shifting sands SBY time frame employed when necessary. So it’s a floating SBY. Turds also float.  
[2018-12-11 23:40:32] <paulkgriffin> "If  a  pilot  is  still  planned  on  an  MMM  duty,  the  pilots  is  still  on  sby  for  the  hours  detailed  on  their    roster. The  pilot  is still  on  standby  for  the  hours detailed on  their roster  (12hrs)."

:thinking_face: What?!!!

So if crewcontrol fail to do their jobs properly and inform us in advance, we are to assume we are now on a longer standby. Me bollix!! 
[2018-12-11 23:56:53] <matthewwilson> Why do they need MMM? Surely they can just roster it as standby when that's what it is?

I'm starting to get suspicious about their motives again. 

---- 2018-12-12 ----
[2018-12-12 00:28:05] <bkehoe00> Matthew, it’s a bodge in the rostering system to protect hours for assignment of a duty and their existence is nothing new. A guy on a normal sby could be maxed on hours and thus be useless or being assigned a flight could push them over the day after. Of course if we had enough crew and weren’t getting maxed to 100hrs then we wouldn’t need them. ;) 
[2018-12-12 02:52:14] <jolmervanbrakel> @paulkgriffin yeah, however: if they roster the mmm like that, and we are now on stby 12h without it being on the roster, I most likely cannot do my next duty the day after. And I might start querying that every time to have it in writing I am not on standby or duty to make sure my FTL are legal :innocent::joy: 
[2018-12-12 05:01:13] <brendanjacobs> Lads Ops A clearly states that they cannot simply expect us to ASSUME that we now have a longer standby if not notified in advance. Even the line in bold is trying to suggest that they have full authority to do what they want. I would suspect there’ll be another memo ‘clarifying’ this memo in a few days.  
[2018-12-12 06:16:24] <brendanjacobs> I also note that the memo is signed by Bernard McSweeney but John Dooly is the file author. If both were involved, surely one of them could have seen that it makes absolutely no sense at all!

We have already discussed the benefits of practicing our skills at low risk fields with benign weather. At some point this BS is going to have to get resolved. The loss of skill in our profession has already cost too many lives.

[2018-12-14 10:11:58] <robwatts99> Back to the company line of practicing during the RST. I don't think that has been on the last 2 RST (not that I remember anyway) so I guess it's approaching 18 months since I have practiced raw data. When I was a FO in PSA usually managed one approach a day.

[2018-12-14 11:05:48] <nilsholdrinet> Same for me, as a FO in GRO most departures and arrivals were raw data. That's where I learned to fly.

[2018-12-14 12:15:58] <bkehoe00> Did it quite often a few years back, just straight through staff security (saying nothing about jumpseating of course) which leaves you in the terminal. They've remodelled a lot in the last few years so not sure if its the same. 
[2018-12-14 12:52:51] <coolhand787> In the good old days in RYR used to do Raw Data T/O to FL150 then switch on automatics and the same in descent. Kept the flying skills sharp. Seems Management don’t want us to practice our skills. The. They need to remove from MEL that we may fly with both FD’s OFF!

[2018-12-14 13:24:12] <ginosabatino> It is a very interesting and wider industry debate. Especially coupled with the fact now you can get into a jet cockpit with even less flying time in aircraft than ever before with an MPL. Remember in years gone past when you needed 700hrs for a CPL?!

We all know AP are extremely reliable, and only a few failures stop its use. They give additional capacity in flight deck, and undoubtedly reduce events happening and generally fly to a more accurate level than a human in very congested airspace.

However, it appears a spate of incidents industry wide could in part be attributed to lack of flying skills. 

Do airlines let 1000s of crews fly with it off, risk an incident, and the potential millions in compensation and lost revenue as well as higher insurance premiums, or ban it, and pray in the rare case of an instance where the crews require the manual skills they get through it...money will always win. 

It definitely needs to be looked at industry wide.

[2018-12-14 14:15:10] <marmargav> Hello! I need your help. Sending this to my pilot friends :small_airplane: ie. You. We built this thing with ICAO to fix Notams. It’s called Norm, and we need to train Norm to understand Notams. Just go here: <https://ops.group/norm2>. Also, pass this on to one more international pilot :male-pilot::skin-tone-2: :female-pilot::skin-tone-2:. If you got this before, it’s Round 2! Nearly working :+1::blush:
 
[2018-12-14 14:16:05] <marmargav> A friend of mine asked me to pass this around. 
[2018-12-14 15:00:26] <matthewwilson> I have it from a good sauce that the reason we can't turn them off comes from the IAA, after numerous screw ups. We should probably blame all those idiots who turned them off, passed the gate unstable and then continued to land. Without those incidents, we'd probably still be allowed to fly raw data. 
[2018-12-14 20:48:33] <tuhhodge> There are a lot of idiots in this company I’m afraid. Just the other day some idiot tried hand flying at high altitude (apparently because he got a stop descent and didn’t trust the AP to level off) and pulled 1.7 G breaking the leg of a pax carrying a baby.  
[2018-12-14 21:01:23] <kilroyrobin> If he practiced flying above 145kts from time to time he would know to be gentle at speed. Is it possible also that he had a perceived fear of a trip to Swords for a disciplinary.

[2018-12-16 19:24:51] <nilsholdrinet> For anyone flying into MUC

They are out of loadsheets there and Ryanair is not supplying them with new ones, because of the electronic loadsheets that's supposed to come in sometime in the next century. So as a request from the dispatcher, if you could please bring some with you if you fly into MUC.

[2018-12-16 19:37:42] <brendanjacobs> Sorry but if Ryanair fail to provide their handling partners with sufficient load sheets then that’s their fucking problem. We shouldn’t be fixing their shit all the time. It’s so bloody frustrating. This is the same penny pinching crap that goes on all the time. Electronic loadsheets coming in, so let’s not spend money printing more of the current ones. I once had to offload 180+ pax onto another aircraft which had to be towed from the hangar because we were getting new non fleet specific QRH’s in a few days, so they didn’t want to waste money printing old ones. No spare QRH for this new delivery aircraft! An aeroplane grounded because some miserly bean counter said it would be a waste of money!

Clean the dog doo off my beloveds shoe I said, that’ll surely win me a place in the good books I said. Well except that I used a dodgy yard brush that I promised to fix last spring, when I shook the excess soap off the heavy head it naturally flung off, then it bounced off the rotten and moss covered deck boards I promised to change last summer. From there the completely frictionless deck surface guided its mass rapidly onwards and upwards. Completely unhindered it struck the window I had been meaning to change since last winter after it was damaged by a builders grinder, at this point the brush head ended its high velocity adventure and smashed the window properly. Now I sit and await the window man. To all Council members across the network may I wish you all a little time to catch up on things this Christmas, may I also wish you a place in ‘the good books’ again, but especially may I wish you a little luck as you go. Shattering the perfectly undamaged window right next to this would have been that little harder to take.

I have it very difficult (I am sure many of you too) to see how the company continues to treat our colleagues in Eindhoven now with the dismissal of all employees there, threats all over the network with disciplinary action and possible dismissal of pilots calling in sick for work. 

I know it has been said many times that we need to be smart when dealing with the company and our unions need to proceed with caution however.....

...my biggest problem is while all of this is going on OUR UNIONS ARE STILL TALKING, NEGOTIATING AND REACHING AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY!!!!!!

In the case of Eindhoven, one pilot group, one union (VNV) is being eliminated and the rest (look picture below) continues to talk to the company, this is Unity??

My humble opinion!

[2018-12-20 08:01:48] <ronan.walsh22> Ageed John, every action by the company has to be delay, divide and conquer. If they can take out a Union by brute force like they did with VNV or they tried with IALPA or tie them up in piecemeal negotiations or promissory agreements. 

The only way to get a sustainable result that benefits all of us is to get out of all of the legal ties and box ticking paper work at the same time. Everyone together. Cabin crew as well even baggage handlers if we can get them and go together at the right time. 

Hopefully Europe figures this out before that time passes....I know a lot of good leaders already know this. 
	:+1: johnfaessel
[2018-12-20 08:16:13] <spac> John, you hit the nail on the head.

Why *SHOULD* the Company change? It is still as arrogant as it ever was. It is brutal to staff, not just to EIN, but what about the crew in Poland who were told to sign up to a new Con-trick, not a con-tract? Those who didn't, have been dismissed. They act with utter impunity. The only body to stand up to them are the UK CAA.

I call on all Unions to act as one and to pull the plug on ALLnegotiations with the Company as of 01/01/2019. The excuses can be that the Company is behaving in any/all of the following:
antagonistic
belligerent
bullying
combative
deceitful
delusional
duplicitous
ethics
morals
stupid
short-sighted
two-faced
unconscionable
unprincipled (edited)

[2018-12-20 08:39:14] <robertassenov> There we go guys.  
[2018-12-20 08:59:23] <kilroyrobin> I can confirm that I have not met one solitary person since I last met with someone from a certain eastern Mediterranean Pilot Association at a Conference in May, either at RTPG, MA Presidential or Council level who does not completely and utterly understand and agree with every solitary word you have written above John. Your humble opinion is factually correct and is the very heart and soul of what drives our most prominent players. The fact that virtually every agreement reached so far has focussed on securing social rights and the defence of members in each nation and securing of a position from which to fight is evidence of this. In Germany Ireland Spain Ireland and Belgium the fundamental thrust of what they have achieved is a defence against exactly what was done in EIN. These cannot be seen as selfish National victories even while our neighbour falls when in fact what is happening is our jimmy jeeps are being replaced with armoured tanks, one by one. We cannot just keep feeding un armoured people into the machine guns. One day we will bring a row of tanks to the horizon, we have to or we will all be run into the ground. Furthermore the national mechanisms of each state simply must be followed through or we will loose their advantage and where we loose the advantage it takes no genius to understand who gains it. I hope this is some reassurance. Finally I would say that where people feel the frustration above, step 1 express it. Step 2 help your council some how or any how, step 3 recruit- add 1. There is no such thing in this war of attrition as a company council that do not need more from every single one of us. *No such thing*, and some councils are in dire need of more help but meet more apathy than appetite for the fight. If this in the end is lost by us it will not have been won by a genius management team as much as it will have given away by those Pilots who stood and watched. There is still more of them than us and that beggars belief given all that has been done, given our successes but especially given our losses, given Eindhoven.

[2018-12-20 09:35:50] <fergus.cassidy> Robin, nail on the head. Everyone wants to see this through and it needs to happen. There is one major problem and that poison spreads like a vine strangling every young oak tree in it's way. But removing that ivy takes a very strong weed killer. Just like a union linked through the RTPG we grow stronger every day. But spring is coming and ticket sales will start to fuel next years profits will not reach targets if the public don't trust the company not to cause strikes again.

Open honest discussion with nobody afraid to speak their minds. Professional Pilots discussing possible solutions to benefit our whole profession. A problem shared is a problem halved :clap: :clap:. 
[2018-12-20 10:03:12] <johnfaessel> Thanks for your words Robin. 

As you mentioned I am expressing myself, talking with P2P’s and have spoken tirelessly to many many young lads, explaining them that there need to be a balance of power in our relationship with the company that can only be achieved via unity and Unions. 

When you brave gentleman walked the roundabout some time ago you made many of us very proud, you walked that roundabout without any of the protection you mentioned above, no armoured, no tanks! 

No greater armor than our UNITY!

[2018-12-20 10:41:08] <kilroyrobin> “Balance of power in our relationship”..”No greater armour than unity” I would bet many of those people you speak to receive the message in very clear and motivational terms. The value of that cannot be underestimated. After all there was once a Captain no doubt who had the very same chat with any one of us in here as nippers. We are not talking to feckless youngsters after all, one of us in here is likely to have the honour of triggering a spark that will ember for some years but will ultimately lead to the youngster becoming an RTPG President. Tom Flood remembers a slow taxi to RW10 with Captain John Goss. I remember a ships Captain telling a 17 year old me that “you can’t afford the oil we could spill or the time you will loose in jail”, funnily enough in flying terms I remember a quick Tenerife and back with Captain John Goss.

It allows him to assess fit to fly based on his own imagination which is more powerful than a real Doctor’s diagnosis. It must be one of those elusive qualifications from NASA!

Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Unity
As she wheeled our wheelbarrow
By roundabouts broad or narrow
Crying "Unity, alive, alive, oh"
Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "Unity, alive, alive, oh"

We fought for our rights, we fought for our 
Profession, we fought for our nation and colleagues alike. 

And sure, t'was no wonder
For so did our mother’s and father’s before. 
And we wheeled our wheel barrow, so margins won’t narrow 
For both passengers or family
Crying “Unity, alive, alive, oh"
Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "Unity, alive, alive, oh"

Fear died of a fever
And no one could save her,
And that was the end of divide and conquer. 

But the ghost of Molly’s dream, and the last of the money, wheels a barrow through streets of change,
Crying, “two hundred thousand, 
for 18hrs a week, 
overpaid taxi drivers alive, alive oh"!

So take your wheel barrow, full of employees money and wheel it somewhere else so the share price recovers, take your wheel barrow while our Airlines still alive alive oh.

[2018-12-24 16:29:46] <kilroyrobin> Unbelievable piece of ‘always getting medieval’ aviation management there. Dr B McShite measures once and cuts twice as you can see by the litany of errors in the text, I’ve even seen our Chief Crayon Officer, (not a man known for his self restraint) pulling him back from fury when I refused an invite into his trap at the negotiating table. Remember though that in 2019 beating bad management will be easy, keeping the pilots together is the hard part. Hard to believe that fact in here I know, but any chance of us loosing comes not from management, it comes instead from right beside us in the flight decks and crew rooms where three thousand pilots stand idley by , shrug their slopey shoulders and watch blindly while we fight with vision. The 3000 who would watch us are the ones who will drag us under should we fail, the only reason our bravery has been tested is because they have shown none of it. It is not the 30 managers who want our demise that would bring our demise. It is those who watch them do it that allow it. Your mission in 2019 is not to be consumed by anger by the sinister minority, but instead you must convert the idle majority. One by one. If each of us convinced 3 more pilots to take part in the space of a 5 day block we would be sorted by Easter, and we could all buy shares in the best company in Europe by summer. Add one!!

It is well worth fixing Ryanair, I am proud of my part along this road and hope many others will join us. DEC like yourself provide a valuable correction to the tint in our glasses that would tend to have the grass greener elsewhere when the truth is it ain’t always so. One certainty is this.

Every step on the hot coals they too had to follow, the pain of uncertainty and every leap of faith was theirs as much as ours, every risk taken, every threat received, every memory of our vindictive opponent, every confidence that to lose was to pay was theirs as well. 

They would be dragged along, never knowing the camaraderie of the picket, never the confidence of the room full of likeminded souls, never knowing the trust but still having to trust, and all while never forgetting the risks.

[2018-12-30 09:47:04] <mrbradleyheap> Anybody else not receiving verified flights email since the last week? I forward them to my electronic logbook for automatic recording, they're very useful to me. 
[2018-12-30 09:47:55] <vcordido> I have the same issue Brad 
[2018-12-30 09:58:13] <edward.scurr> @mrbradleyheap which electronic logbook do you use where you can forward these emails and have entered automatically?  
[2018-12-30 10:01:47] <vcordido> I send the emails to ryalogger and then import them to logtenpro 
[2018-12-30 10:03:15] <mrbradleyheap> MCC Pilot Log. I think I have the enterprise edition but I'm not sure that matters. It's a great feature, but the easy life is reliant on the emails coming from Ryanair, which has been fine for years until this week.
I also forward the email to Ryalogger and my personal email for archiving at the same time. (edited)

[2018-12-30 10:07:29] <spac> MCC is excellent. It's a one-off payment of about €90 for life, unlike others who stiff you annually.
You can add the second pilot by entering:
SIC : BLOGGS
within the report. Do it for each sector. Forward it to the cloud, and synchronise with your PC once in a while. Keeps everything tickety-boo.

[2018-12-30 11:15:47] <peter.j.marriott> I had the same issue with the verified flights. I went back into the EFL and re-submitted them; I then got the emails. A lot of issues with the EFL this last week.

[2018-12-30 15:16:37] <bkehoe00> I got mine from 26th and 27th just fine. Took ages to verify flights on 26th though due EFL issue.

I will take that peace with me to march on any roundabout we may find again. Who knew you could find peace in a fight. I suppose it’s obvious really that a man is tormented by the absence of a fight where one is so badly needed, just as it was with us. There are still a few across the aisle who look the other way, oblivious to our view, we’ll just show them the light. So brothers and sisters of the march, let’s have a peaceful 2019 of all out war.

[2019-01-04 06:48:48] <sam.vanherzele> Apparently if you were sick and didn't follow procedure (call &gt;2 hrs before, self certificate, doctor cert for longer absence,...) they make you work extra days to recover it. Calculation seems to be 1 RWD for every 1 day sick.  
[2019-01-04 09:36:13] <bkehoe00> That'd make sense as this was a thing added in the addendums regarding productivity bonus so any base that accepted the addendum agreed to UA/A to be recovered.

SWAPA took out a full page add in USA Today thanking him for his service to the airline when he retired. (I very much doubt the same will be done here). Quote: “you have to treat your employees like customers. Treat them right then they will treat customers right”. Quote: “because I am unable to perform competently any meaningful function at Southwest, our employees let me be CEO”. When the airline ran into financial difficulty in its first two years, it chose to sell off one of its four 737s rather than lay off employees. To engage with customers Mr. Kelleher would often board flights just to chat with customers.

[2019-01-06 14:22:12] <remco.spelt> Hey Serks. I will bring it up in the council and will let you know. 
[2019-01-06 14:57:58] <brendanjacobs> So nobody got granted unpaid leave! Please ask around in base guys. The info is needed to help with a current IALPA task. 
[2019-01-06 15:14:08] <paulkgriffin> Is it not just cabin crew striking? 
[2019-01-06 15:17:12] <gallegovendrell> Indeed yes 
[2019-01-06 16:12:08] <boston58730> My worry is that they would roster rotations similar to what now happens in MRS and EIN. 
In any case I would not like to screw over any colleagues or indeed break any laws. I doubt FR would help me out if the police came calling. 
[2019-01-06 16:15:37] <kilroyrobin> It is very rare that a union member from another state, other than the state on strike, can refuse a strike busting duty and be covered by their own Union. It is a frustrating reality, equally though it was baffling to note that some pilots will surrender a day of hard earned rest in order to strike bust a colleague. I would have thought in the busy summer schedule they would have been concerned about fatigue with such extra duties, but yet the hotels in Dublin were full of these guys. Portugal is an exception and there are others. In Portugal it is illegal to replace a striking employee, however we are Pilots and not cabin crew. Extreme caution and un emotional decision making is required here as the law in Europe currently favours the employer in any transnational labour conflict.

Nice bike trip today past our Presidents house - catching up on lost time with the kids and wondering what I missed in 2017 & 18 with my head stuck at the front line, wondering how many of these moments are being missed right now today by other council members stepping up and surrendering their home time across the network, even while others step down or wear out in this war of attrition. During mediation in August it was already ruled out and accepted that the pilfering trick of assigning leave to days off is dead and gone. The pocket lifting of 3 days per year through the month off system is already busted by good Union work. The Question then is this:- Of the three days effectively recovered already by this work would you give up one for your council? Would the Pilot body invest one of their own days of annual leave for their council on an ongoing basis? Well would you? Let’s show the RTPG President and his crew our support for this small token that could deliver permanent and sustainable strength to the winds of change, because as we know they don’t blow by themselves, they blow by sweat, blood, dedication and often at home they take even more. Be a part of the change, this contribution of a day is exactly as it is already done in many other successful Airlines - give this idea the 👍

[2019-01-10 11:07:32] <brendanjacobs> <!channel> I’ll try this another way. Has any employee pilot EVER been granted unpaid leave for less than 1 month? Please let me know. It’s important we have this information. 
[2019-01-10 11:09:05] <jwarren> I got 1 block unpaid granted this month Brendan. (edited)
[2019-01-10 11:09:08] <felix.bamesreiter> Yes I had one block unpaid leave between Christmas and New year 
[2019-01-10 11:09:14] <andrewsawkins> Put a request in,and was told no unpaid leave available at my base (STN) 
[2019-01-10 11:11:26] <tfreund.uk> Yes I had 1 block of unpaid leave in December 2018. 
[2019-01-10 11:15:35] <rogierbrink> Had 2 blocks u/l in winter 2016 
[2019-01-10 11:15:59] <dermotferguson> I requested a block of unpaid for the end of January and was denied due not available in Dublin. 
[2019-01-10 11:17:19] <marjus1> What’s the net loss in pay (£stg) per block?  
[2019-01-10 11:19:44] <biondina> I had 1 day on the 24th of December this year 
[2019-01-10 11:24:24] <gmulcair99> Applied for any week unpaid from Sept to March - told none was available in Dub  
[2019-01-10 11:32:34] <rupertlamb> I have had parental leave, always granted but check you salary payments subsequently. 
[2019-01-10 11:37:00] <johnfaessel> Never asked for unpaid leave, so not able to help! 
[2019-01-10 11:37:57] <segolene.chenin> I had 1 day of U/L in December 
[2019-01-10 11:42:30] <brendanjacobs> Ok guys, lots of good info there. Thanks for the help! Now if there’s anyone who had a period of unpaid leave of LESS than a full month before the summer strikes, that would be VERY helpful! 
[2019-01-10 12:03:50] <danieltierney1> Strange that the videos have been taken down now. :thinking_face:  
[2019-01-10 12:07:40] <iglehane> Yeap. Maybe someone sent a link to the safety office 
[2019-01-10 12:10:28] <robwatts99> I remember a danish guy who upgraded and sent to MLA. I know he wanted dub and had him on jumpseat last year and he was still waiting. Can't say he still waiting and don't have contact for him. So basically my post is useless :joy: 
[2019-01-10 12:47:29] <tomflood737> Rob, there’s no such thing as a useless post on Slack.  
[2019-01-10 13:12:39] <fede_0411> Hey Rob, as far as I know the Danish guy got Dublin recently.  
[2019-01-10 13:23:07] <brendanjacobs> <!channel> Sorted on the unpaid leave issue, thanks! Next issue: some people sent me info on this before but I can’t find it! Anyone had parental or paternity leave granted in the last year or so? (edited)
[2019-01-10 13:24:00] <gallegovendrell> I did 
[2019-01-10 13:25:20] <andrewsawkins> Yes I had two months shared parental leave, two weeks paternity leave and 1 week parental leave in total for 2018 
[2019-01-10 13:25:37] <marconania> I had one block from 31st December, and will have 1 block in February and 1 in March  
[2019-01-10 13:29:18] <tfreund.uk> I had 1 "week" parental leave in 2018. 1 week for Ryanair is 4 days. They refused to give me a full block.  
[2019-01-10 13:38:52] <rednose> 8 times a ‘week’. First 5 days then they changed it to 4 days. Had to fill up d week with a/l 
[2019-01-10 13:42:20] <paulcooper> I have parental leave this June. Again only 4 days granted. I  did question the legality of this and they said they are playing by the rules..... 
[2019-01-10 13:45:40] <andrewsawkins> It funny how they divided 203 working days by 52 weeks that would only give us 3.9 days as a working week.
But this year we had to give 3 days up in Nov and December plus two extra days a year when we go in the sim so this brings the total to 203+3+3+2=211 days a year divided by 52 = 4.06 
So shouldn’t we get 5 days off now? 
[2019-01-10 13:47:05] <andrewsawkins> Also we have to available in our free time off to complete online courses 
[2019-01-10 13:47:56] <brendanjacobs> The more I look into this, the bigger the mess becomes! It’s all over the place, different methods of calculation for everyone. This is why it needs sorting. They must be prevented from short changing people and made comply with the law! 
[2019-01-10 13:49:31] <andrewsawkins> We’ve tried BALPA, ACAS, and the citizens advice with no luck so far 
[2019-01-10 13:50:49] <stephenmjacob14> Hey Tom, Fiona Barry dealt with mine in December. <mailto:barryf@ryanair.com|barryf@ryanair.com> dont have a number for her though.  
[2019-01-10 13:51:58] <andrewsawkins> The problem is, they say we only work 203 days a year. But we can’t go and work for another airline on our time off, so this means we have to be available all year.
This is a loophole they have found to make it difficult for us.
 
[2019-01-10 14:13:58] <arnaud2cagny> Damn I missed it! 
[2019-01-10 14:27:40] <justincharbon> I had PL first two weeks of Nov 2017, it was following my month off  
[2019-01-10 14:47:30] <dermotferguson> On two blocks of paternity leave at the moment  
[2019-01-10 15:00:26] <t_mc_c> :+1: 
[2019-01-10 16:30:47] <rupertlamb> As previous, I have used it a lot recently, never been refused but only in four day blocks to get the full five days you need two blocks of which you are allowed four per year per child under 18. Watch salary payment post fact they will deduct for five or six days. Legally in the UK they only have to give in blocks of four, At a Stn townhall Bellew said he would look into it...... 
[2019-01-10 16:55:49] <pierre.dsp> On two blocks of PL at the moment as well

[2019-01-10 19:57:28] <brendanjacobs> If the root cause of the delays are ‘a combination of ATC failures and ground handling issues’, what are the number 1’s supposed to do to fix that? All this does is put a ‘perceived pressure’ on number 1’s and in turn the rest of their crew to rush their checks!

[2019-01-10 21:04:14] <kev1kel> Got mine this week. Great article by a chap called Kilroy also. 
[2019-01-10 21:14:41] <frankobr> I’m going to keep one engine running. Should save 5 mins.  :joy: 
[2019-01-10 21:15:28] <kilroyrobin> You lads didn’t leave me short on inspiration, we are a busy lot around here, some band of brothers and sisters we have. It’s  been an unmatchable gift in life to have been trusted for a turn at the wheel of such a force of human endeavour and integrity as we all have become. Pilots who meet the order of ultimate professionalism in the flight deck and in life now too, and we bloody well know it. We earned our stripes.  
[2019-01-10 21:21:30] <andy.airamerica> 1.how many bloody dept. managers, directors or flight operations managers have they got! There seems to be dozens of managers and nobody actually managing. Every week there’s a memo from someone new. 
2. punctuality. No “perceived” time pressure exists in this company at all :face_with_rolling_eyes:. Except on time performance appear in weekly memos :face_with_rolling_eyes:
3. As Brendan says all this will succeed in doing is incentivize crew to cut corners. HOW CAN I REALLY TRUST THAT THE CABIN IS SECURE NOW? Can I? Has that cabin secure chime come from a desire for a £1000 bonus or is it actually safe to ask for pushback?.

Yet RYR does not care, by calling you to DUB or sending letters to pressure you to come fly even when unfit to do so! And then we know the story, RYR hypocritically hides behind OM A if unfit to fly don’t fly... Bottom line you go fly unfit it is the CREWMEMBER’s RESPONSIBILITY and sure RYR will blame you... Wonder why... maybe cos they are very short of pilots and can not ‘afford’ flight crew members being sick...:thinking_face:

My first recurrent Sim as a Captain had under 3700 hrs total sitting up front, (including both of us) and that happens on the line here on a regular basis. Bean counters say that’s OK Because we can’t make business decisions based on outlying events. Pilots say it’s not, that’s because our entire checklist is written by outlying events, such as this, such as CIA.  
[2019-01-16 09:34:47] <spac> Recruitment.

A few weeks ago there was a fanfare with the news that 1100 pilots had been recruited in the previous 12 months.

Does anybody recall if there was a similar one a year ago? It would be interesting to get out the side-rule and calculate the implied increase in the workforce over that period.

Then look at the real number of pilots.
Then see the attrition rate over the period.

[2019-01-18 11:53:25] <thomas> Besides it is the first profit warning this year, the last one was in 2018. That's the problem with people like EW, they live in the past. Perhaps closing a profitable base like Eindhoven was a bad idea, solely based on the need for vengeance and reprisals for people striking. How's that working out for ya? Ryanair is now funding type ratings for new cadets which, again, is an added cost. If they were to weigh their options and aim for pilot retention rather than pilot accretion then I am sure it will save them money in the long run. But like I said, people like EW are stuck in the past and more importantly stuck in their ways. There is no way these people are going to make Ryanair the place it needs to be for the future and survival of the airline, it is definitely time for them to step aside. But hey, that's just my opinion.

[2019-01-18 21:10:26] <albertbessler> Interesting that they managed to pressurize the cabin to 5000’ below sea level. What does that even feel like?  
[2019-01-18 21:13:32] <swfmcmanus> Wow, compared to the precautions you have to take scuba diving descending and ascending to save your ears and prevent decompression sickness this is on a whole different level. (edited)
[2019-01-18 21:13:54] <tomflood737> Like scuba diving I suppose, or deep sea diving to more specific.  
[2019-01-18 21:20:39] <swfmcmanus> Touché  
[2019-01-18 21:38:34] <pilot> They descended with a closed valve AND working packs. Thus pressurizing. Didn’t check during descent. 
But have to admit very poor design of the cab alt indication,showing very high altitude when in fact i was below MSL.  
[2019-01-18 21:39:24] <bkehoe00> Think that happened one of ours before with a suspected tail strike where they initially opened the valve above 10,000ft. The cab alt needle just goes anti clockwise below 0 back into the 50kft and below area when the cabin is over pressurising. The previous crew got it to minus 8000ft I think and didn’t realise till they couldn’t open the doors on the ground! Disappointing an improved display of pressurisation system couldn’t be fitted to the Max.  
[2019-01-18 23:12:31] <mark_gilmour99> I was previously unaware that the cabin alt needle could go past the stop but common sense should tell the crew that cabin alt can never be above ac alt plus the diff needle would have revealed all. 
[2019-01-18 23:26:16] <gmulcair99> The problem of the cabin altitude needle going counter clockwise past 0 happened before. Jeju 738 in Korea 

<http://avherald.com/h?article=49158d84>

Very confusing for the crew being at 9000 or 10000 feet and cabin altitude showing 33000 -  36000 feet.

[2019-01-19 09:17:59] <albertbessler> A tough situation. Don’t think I would have handled it any better, even in the comfort of my arm chair. You’re not checking The pressurization during descent. You’re running the checklist and getting the aircraft down. 

In the end they worked out what was wrong and corrected the error. The error bring mainly the checklist and a system design which should have been made redundant decades ago.

[2019-01-20 12:28:47] <brendanjacobs> They never used to overbook. That changed recently. Tom has hit the nail on the head. The pax number quoted to the market is based on seats sold (at €9.99!) and not on pax flown! People who are serious about traveling, book with other carriers for fear of their flight being cancelled due strike! The ones that buy the cheap flash sale seats are just taking a punt at the possibility they may get time off work. Usually they don’t make use of that ticket.

[2019-01-20 13:30:35] <dieuwkebleeker> Performance department has for many sectors a max pax number (some sectors around 170). Max pax means a lower cruise altitude and more fuel. The revenue of the last 20 odd pax must be higher than the cost of the extra fuel. And many times it isn't. So max numbers were established. However, If you have a no show number of 10 to 20% as we have a the moment, you can sell more tickets knowing they won't travel. What I see lately is that we are filed at a flight level we can't reach if most pax do show up. Sometimes not even 100Nm later. 
[2019-01-20 14:20:34] <boswellbrown> Have been surprised to see big differentials booked vs actual on certain price sensitive destinations to the East. The number of no-shows has certainly gone up. Have seen prices at less than €5 for quite a range of destinations. I’m assuming it’s part of the numbers game to make all look fine to the outside observer. The real problem is when yields remain soft going into Easter and summer bookings and the flattering pax numbers don’t compensate.

[2019-01-20 22:55:40] <bkehoe00> Dieuwke, do you mean that Lido asks for say FL380 as first flight level, but the FMC Max is below 380 even though our actual ZFW is similar to the Estimated? I’ve noticed this recently and was suspicious it’s because we’ll shortly be using our actual CG so maybe the higher level will be available. (edited)
[2019-01-20 22:57:35] <tuhhodge> A shit sandwich but there will be many more weeks where you spend far less on accommodation than the hourly uplift and end up playing the tax system too. (edited)

I remember my kids trying to figure out theirs at a similar age, it’s the same fascination all this time later to watch your shadow fall upon another world, on I went into the airport and it was cool to see so many other people pause to answer an age old fascination with a skyward glance to search for our shadow among the blazing lights. All of our shadows in one place. Makes you feel small, it’s good to fix this hurtling ball we live in one way or another, after all there is no other.

[2019-01-21 21:08:25] <kilroyrobin> I’ll never be gone from this, just like  the hundreds of others who found that when they stepped up with the Union they somehow had a gift. Whether the gift comes from the person first or from solidarity itself I’m never sure, but the talent I have found in all who have put their mind to this is absolutely one of the most remarkable things I have known. I think it is because it needs a hundred different talents in order to bring a hand of cards worth playing to the negotiating table which means by default that it doesn’t matter what your gift might be as it will find a place in our fight. Once you bring yourself to the fight both you and the fight will find a place in a way that is more than either were before. Solidarity is synergy and thank goodness it’s as addictive as crack because there’s never a shortage of those who shoot up on greed.

Take extreme caution with the OPT W&amp;B (as stated in the memo it is a major change with just a short e-learning), take your time.

***Another memo stating: ¨Effective 22nd January 2019 until further notice, crews are required to document TOW &amp; CG on the LID when dispatching from Italian airports.¨ ***

I would love to hear feedback if possible in following format:
- was all information on LID correct?
- was it provided -10 STD?
- Where you able to complete calculations in 10min?
- Is it as easy as the Ryanair e-learning module?
- Any other relevant information/tips for other crews to look out for (as there won´t be the x-checks like the old paper load sheet anymore)

Summary of tips below:
-  1 (André) : For all captains, no matter what, you are responsible if anything goes wrong
-  2 (Robin) : any delay 62
-  3 (Sam) : OPT W&amp;B doesn´t work with TAXI WEIGHT being higher then placard TOW
- 4 (Tom) : do it by the book, no short cuts nor rushing to save perceived time and remember -Read - Look - Listen.
- 5 (Andrew) : If issue with TAXI weight vs TOW (see tip 3) use higher placard weight to ensure correct input in OPT, better safe then sorry
- 6 (Fergus) : Use delay code 31 when LID is not there -10 STD
- 7 (Bert) : Use delay code 62 for all other cases
- 8 (Andy/Alex) : Don´t forget to use standard. 79 density instead of 0.803 (New OPT)
- 9 (Andy) : Before the 1st day on the line with this new OPT W&amp;B do the e-learning once more for your own sake
- 10 (myself) : felt strange not writing down thrust settings, speeds etc. However after first time (around 6 min delay) the second time it took only a few minutes extra (without rushing). The problem lies with the fact that the LID never arrives - 10 or even -5. You need at least 5min to complete all the steps and send output. Then checklist and clearance for start up.... So good luck 25 min turnaround... It should be 30 minutes now.
- 11 ( Andy) : use the Bug Card for reference. Just click the 3 items before sending it. The top one says “View Bug Card”.

[2019-01-21 22:19:57] <sam.vanherzele> Already some feedback on how useless the app is:
When close to the placard weight OPT is not willing to calculate anything, OPT uses 'taxi weight' for calculations whereas the placard is a max takeoff weight. 

Example:
ZFW 58000kg
+Fuel 8900kg
=TOW 66900kg
Taxi fuel 190kg
'Taxi weight' 67090kg
Try to put 67090 into OPT (with 66990 placard) and you will get errors...
Try to change the OPT placard weight and you can start all over again to put all data in without perceived time pressure... (edited)

[2019-01-21 22:48:08] <tomflood737> The best recommendation is to do it by the book, no short cuts nor rushing to save perceived time. 

Most important, don’t rush other duties to try and catch up - Read - Look - Listen. 

Every minute saved by rushing and stressing probably takes 2 minutes off your expected life due to stress.

[2019-01-22 07:45:07] <fergus.cassidy> Time is yours, use it. Perceived time pressure is the equivalent response of a management pilot flying when every ground staff member knows who they are and works with a full team. They never see the reality. Finish the fuel supervisor, load your ATIS data, enter the LID data and cross reference, even the slightest error, go back and check. 
Then delay code 62 and make a note due to  "fuel supervision and independent loadsheet calculations flight delayed. If LID is not there -10 late loadsheet code as the paperwork was not presented on time and again make a note"
I tried a couple yesterday and it can't let you change between placard weights without resetting all data. If near the placard weight use the higher one. Stupid system needs to have been trialed for longer, rolled out in a number of bigger bases first to get a larger feedback from crews. And most importantly it was supposed to replace the fuel supervisor. But that would have cost money paying for an extra staff on the ground.
Take your time. It's your licence.

[2019-01-22 09:00:50] <johnmurray737> I’d say they pay the route charges by what’s submitted by us Brad but of course the tech log is master.  
[2019-01-22 09:04:32] <fergus.cassidy> Yes, tech log will be master. Selecting the placard weight is the equivalent to ticking the placard weight on the paper loadsheet. The EFL sets the airways charges by the weight we set there.

“Earn up to....” 
[2019-01-22 11:51:52] <coolhand787> Yep Bert DLY codes are there to be used. No abuse of our licenses and as Tom said shortening our lives by unnecessary stress. Plus if anything goes wrong, the CPT is at fault. If loading/trim etc error and as Fergus already mentioned aircraft are less nose heavy the risk of Tailstrikes increases. Especially with new cadets or FO’s who were ‘recommended’ to pull through the dead band... Remain vigilant and take time is the key issue. Let RYR pay for the delays rather than pilots/CPTs for mistakes/mishaps. It’s our license after all!

[2019-01-22 12:34:24] <coolhand787> Well Sam for those having flown in Northen Latitudes above the Arctic Circle temperatures of -25 C are common and there the snow does not stick to the aircraft it simply blows off as the wings are really similar in temperature. This is of course not valid for clear ice but powder snow as it is called just flies away, therefore lift is not impaired. One can see it quite well on the video. Here the aircraft internal systems and engines need more attention. Therefore ground heating carts for the cabin will operate all night and fanblades/engines will be heated prior to departure! And these are real cold weather/arctic WX conditions. And if lots of snow on the wings this is removed with broomsticks 🧹 (edited)

[2019-01-22 19:32:02] <joshuabowers1> In AGP, 10 tonnes of fuel to be slowly uplifted, no sign of the loading info. FO gets in -5 to start the brief. I’m sure I remember the old adage ‘if you don’t start ribets before -10 YOU WILL BE LATE’. So where do we stand with ribets -5 and then the entire W+B with performance? ....

[2019-01-22 21:17:07] <padibartolomeo> Those guys are dangerous . Why on earth would you even remotely take the risk of stalling an airliner just to save some minutes for deicing? I remember when I was FO and a CPT from eastern EU wanted to do something like that , taking off from TRF. I eventually insisted we had to de-ice, so he told me : “ ok , if you’re scared we de-ice”. He then took the tech log , put it on my lap and let me deal with it on my own until we took off . Good old times :joy: (edited)

[2019-01-23 08:13:01] <approachalex> You do not use 0.803 in the tech log. You use normal procedure, putting the total fuel from the aircraft in to the OPT. The OPT W&amp;B just uses 0.803 to fill the wing tanks to 3930 each side.

[2019-01-23 08:49:48] <kilroyrobin> Exactly Damiano the current Irish Billionaire friendly economy and blind eye governance that sits like a wart on the side of Europe’s face is being used to poison labour rights right across the European Union, and Ireland does not deserve to have its age old and cherished image turned into a flag of convenience for the sake of a single generation of hostile and greedy executives. Especially not when it comes at the expense of virtually everyone else and all the security that citizens rightly own borne of a thousand generations of those who stood up before us. This is not society we are watching, we are watching an attack on it, this is why it is a matter of national pride to me that the Irish Pilots have taken such a stand. It is also why we enjoyed the support of the Irish public, on every step at the roundabout the horns blared in support.  
[2019-01-23 09:12:33] <damiano.detomassi> And proud you should be .

---- 2019-01-24 ----
[2019-01-24 00:51:20] <remco.spelt> - 10 (myself) : felt strange not writing down thrust settings, speeds etc. However after first time (around 6 min delay) the second time it took only a few minutes extra (without rushing). The problem lies with the fact that the LID never arrives - 10 or even -5. You need at least 5min to complete all the steps and send output. Then checklist and clearance for start up.... So good luck 25 min turnaround... It should be 30 minutes now.

Tbank you all for contributing so much to this thread. Let's keep om communicating and sharing:reminder_ribbon: :muscle: 
[2019-01-24 08:15:56] <boston58730> Completed my first two sectors using the OPT weight and balance now. I am honestly afraid that I will no longer enjoy my job. Took ages to work through and one of the sectors was out of trim with the dispatcher long gone.

What did we gain by going paperless? 
[2019-01-24 08:27:10] <fergus.cassidy> The dispatchers are paid less. That's it plus there's usually some other plan to be brought in, in the near future. 4 sectors yesterday, first sector LID at -10 so pushed on time. Last 3 sectors LID after all passengers boarded so late all 3 sectors. Dl31 late load sheet with a written note. 
[2019-01-24 08:52:18] <robwatts99> The only benefit I see is takes the human error out of the loadsheet. I'm on my month off right now so haven't had to use the system but does seem deeply flawed. The trim been the big issue because as mentioned by the time you find the problem the doors are closed and the dispatcher is gone. Surely just a paperless loadsheet app would have been sufficient?  
[2019-01-24 09:16:54] <swfmcmanus> I did it the first time yesterday, missed a few things along the way but got them later in the day. I won't sign the loadsheet until I'm happy to push, at least the dispatcher can't leave then.  
[2019-01-24 09:24:29] <jssasanow> Definitely, if the LID doesn’t arrive with everything else done at -10 you’ve no chance.  Fuel supervision will prevent that. If you’re borderline between 2 weights you may have to do the whole thing twice as changing the weight means you need to start over. Also my FOs EFB wiped everything on changing tabs so had to do it twice the other day anyway. Way more work, no extra time, delay code 62.  
[2019-01-24 09:28:53] <arpadheger1977> Yesterday, the Dispatcher stayed on as long as the loadsheet was complete. Once it was confirmed, it is all correct, he left the airplane. “Signing” the loadsheet, finish the FMC, putting on the belts etc..... we were just finished as the doors were closed. Currently I do not see any win let the dispatcher go before it is not confirmed trim is ok. 
[2019-01-24 09:36:33] <jssasanow> Yeah keeping the dispatcher until it’s confirmed in trim is key 
[2019-01-24 09:38:47] <paulkgriffin> If it is out of trim just play with the zone figures until it works. I was all locked up when the out of trim was noticed but by moving 3 pax forward it fixed it. Quick ding to the No1 and problem sorted. It was an empty flight though. 
[2019-01-24 09:47:33] <fergus.cassidy> The booking system puts all the pac in the rear of the cabin. I had 2 in the front, other zones nearly full, so put 10 from mid to front. All sorted. Biggest issue is late LID and constant interruptions in the last few minutes while trying to check figures. Major distraction issue with obvious safety errors.

[2019-01-24 10:04:14] <fergus.cassidy> As Shane said above, don't sign the LID till the electronic loadsheet is done and sent. Equivalent to signing the paper loadsheet.

Still too many bags been priority booked into the cabin. Properly done, the dispatchers should have an electronic device that could send us the LID details from the gate. But that would involve something more than Ryanair lavs. Only shite comes out of there.

[2019-01-24 10:24:00] <robertgormley53> The pax are choosing seats at the rear of the cabin at booking stage cos they're cheaper. So if its a half full flight, moving pax forward is probably gonna be common

[2019-01-24 10:48:58] <ginosabatino> The company has become a wet dream for efficiency...

years ago with the 200s you had about 120ish pax? Now you are moving an extra 60 inbound and 60 outbound (an entire 737-200 worth of pax!), doing fuelling supervisor and load sheets now, whilst the crews are paid less than they were 20 years ago, with the same notional 25 min turnaround...

[2019-01-24 16:07:48] <joshuabowers1> Any significant Human Error in the loadsheet would always be caught by comparing the EZFW and pax numbers from EFL. Small variances due to child adjustments/bags but 1 tonne = 1kt. The real danger has always been gross errors not being caught out. I won’t be signing the LID until I can crosscheck the EZFW and marry that with how many pax have/haven’t shown up at the gate. Admittedly only had 1 day on the line so far but as long as we are still responsible for RFS duties, if the LID does not arrive at -10 there will be a delay. We need to asking management when RFS duties will end, as promised with the introduction of OPT W+B. (edited)
[2019-01-24 16:41:59] <fergus.cassidy> :point_up: 
[2019-01-24 17:28:28] <biondina> Today we had a low load to STN from CGN. We where out of trim so moved 6 pax from mid to front. When we returned to CGN the dispatcher already told us they got a call from Dublin requesting the reason why the aircraft was out of trim and why that caused a delay. 
You can’t make this up a new procedure and after 3 days they already complain to the handling people for delays. I’m sure in a few months we will be more used to the procedure but it takes time. They want the problem solved in 1 day. 

I have already said they need to make a app for the handling agent with a generic aircraft to see if the aircraft is in trim from the start and not let us find out at STD -5 or less. 

I’m also not letting him/her go until I and my FO are satisfied with the weight and balance. Any delay will go on DL62. With a nice description in the captain remarks.  
[2019-01-24 18:46:20] <swfmcmanus> I'd give it a week or so and peille will have a routine figured out. Once you're sending the email then sign the loadsheet and you'll be sorted.  
[2019-01-24 18:50:34] <swfmcmanus> Is there any statement from the unions planned for the media regarding the suspended communications? Surely the media picking up that industrial action is still on the cards this summer would help our case. IALPA and a few other are very quiet and if a union is as strong as its members perhaps we should be aiming for a headline instead while things are being done in the background?

[2019-01-24 19:17:54] <brendanjacobs> Never heard of it because most other airlines just pay the compensation. In our case Ryanair don’t but people can’t be bothered fighting it. It looks like they got someone stubborn and willing to take it all the way.  
[2019-01-24 19:20:31] <martin.loxbo> To clarify it’s a flight of more than 1500 km so no compensation is due since the delay was less than 3 hrs. I’m a bit curious how it would all go down :see_no_evil: 
[2019-01-24 19:28:41] <fergus.cassidy> Probably settled on the steps as usual. 
[2019-01-24 19:41:33] <derekfdoyle> A Head of Dick Heads would be more appropriate! 
[2019-01-24 19:42:46] <andy.airamerica> They’ll assign you a leave day to appear too :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
[2019-01-24 19:44:00] <fergus.cassidy> Too many equally qualified staff already.  
[2019-01-24 19:44:51] <martin.loxbo> Are you serious? No way I would accept that. It would be duty performed for Ryanair. I get paid or I don’t go. 
[2019-01-24 20:36:03] <marjus1> Bullseye.

[2019-01-25 09:30:40] <derekirl> Cheers Sam  
[2019-01-25 09:48:03] <tomflood737> I had this before an SEP day, others on the course on the same pattern had to work, so not sure of the logic. 

 
[2019-01-25 09:50:35] <fergus.cassidy> You're probably on earlies so I believe they can't say N/A.  Either way it's not a known code so phone off.  
[2019-01-25 09:53:27] <derekirl> :+1: 
[2019-01-25 10:15:58] <martin.loxbo> It just turned up on my roster. Was originally 4 sectors, 8 hrs block. No idea how they’re planning it as I haven’t been told a thing, and it’s in a week. 
[2019-01-25 10:18:37] <fergus.cassidy> You'll turn up, settled on the fourth steps as always. Is it the high court or civil court, later more likely. 
[2019-01-25 10:19:17] <martin.loxbo> It’s in Barcelona apparently! 
[2019-01-25 10:21:00] <fergus.cassidy> Must be filed under local Spanish law. 
[2019-01-25 10:28:07] <samkettle16> I know of cabin crew who have had to appear in court Martin and they got assigned N/A, but like you said, I’d try and get some sort of remuneration for it, especially as you’re representing them on a professional basis. 
[2019-01-25 10:30:34] <coolhand787> Yep Derek as Fergus suggested wisely Do not disturb ON! Cos otherwise RYR will blame you for picking up the phone if you resting or not available to fly.. and call you for a Disciplinary meeting :thinking_face: 
[2019-01-25 10:30:52] <martin.loxbo> I’m Storm and I can’t find the part of my contract where it says I have to defend Ryanair in court. :joy: 
[2019-01-25 10:33:05] <fergus.cassidy> No one can ethically defend Ryanair in court and Ryanair don't want you on that stand either. If asked the reason for the delay if you have to say no spare crew, no engineer available etc. 
[2019-01-25 10:37:09] <martin.loxbo> I looked through the records and it’s easy to “defend”: First sector basically 1.5 hrs delay waiting for the aircraft to show up, then another 1.5 hrs on slot. Second sector, which is the one they are suing for just had delay 93. 
[2019-01-25 10:47:10] <andy.airamerica> A full list of all roster codes should be added to the right side of that page.

[2019-01-25 12:10:32] <manudn2> How can I get a confirmation/certification... from RYR of my Flt hours ?  
[2019-01-25 12:58:28] <bkehoe00> Knock on delays they have to pay compo for though, so if the aircraft was missing then it’s perceived as something they had control over, eg could have flown in spare a/c but they will deny pax the money and say it was because of whatever reason delayed the aircraft on its previous sectors. Sounds like your statement will mean case settled in favour of the pax!  
[2019-01-25 13:03:04] <bkehoe00> The booking system should be able to run a cross check of the pax loading at the very beginning. Pax shouldn’t all be assigned seats in the back with nobody in the front but the logic of the system is to diligently fill the mid zone with people who haven’t paid. It should be programmed to randomly sit people evenly throughout the aircraft...I’ve had almost full aft zone with like 3 or 4 people in the front zone the last couple of days I flew.  
[2019-01-25 13:09:21] <andy.airamerica> I think you should send a query to flight ops deparment. You’ll have to go to HQ to collect the document with a stamp on it from Ray. I think that’s how its one. 
[2019-01-25 13:12:41] <andy.airamerica> Ladies &amp; Gents if anybody knows of anyone who is having problems with IALPA membership, not receiving emails etc etc can you please get their details (full name and email) and send me a message so I can rectify the issue. Thanks. 
[2019-01-25 13:24:02] <kilroyrobin> will do 
[2019-01-25 13:53:18] <paulkgriffin> Is the loading of pax at the back not deliberate to keep the CoG aft thus reducing drag?! 
[2019-01-25 14:07:13] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FFP35S0KD with text: Why didn’t I just leave years ago, sometimes I wonder, sometimes management probably wonder too. The reason is that Ryanair is a tale of two cities. 

I came here in 2005 and learned to fly a Boeing, and I learned it well. The training department took me from Cadet to Captain just like 10,000 others. In the time I have been here I would have done well over 50 Simulator sessions, never in that time have I met an instructor who was checking rather than instructing. Only twice did I feel my instructor was unable to instruct, and both times it was the same man. Now I speak to all my friends who did leave. They tell me that this statistic by any standard in any airline is a bloody good average, especially when we know the role of the bean counter in this equation - That of exact opposition.

After they finished teaching me how to fly, they set about teaching me how to be a Pilot, how to listen, how to manage an airplane, how to manage a crew, how to manage myself, how to speak up, teamwork, TEM, what is right, not who is right, all this wisdom right here in Ryanair, but what completely cracks my nuts in this company is that all this wisdom is here, but not where it needs to be most. Not at the top.

When I was at sea the Captain came before God. He was always right, and never questioned.  If he was good the ship was good, if he was a bully - and there were many - the ship and its crew would rot and fester from the head out to its toe. After that was done, things would start to go properly wrong. You can imagine how good it was then to come here and learn of advocacy, encouraging your juniors opinion to be heard before your own, avoidance of positive bias, the study of human factors, the holy grail of honest reflection of your performance as shown by a facilitated debrief. 

Then you look at the way management here operates. The Captain is before God in our management, and so it rots from the head. In the summer of 2017 people were running from HQ crying that the Pigs had taken over in Animal farm, they knew disaster was coming but were beyond another try at not being heard, and so they stood back and watched as the roof came in. The tale of two cities is a tale of two very different cities. Ours is right. 

I recently re read my own initial Command Line check comments, which meant that bit more to me now that I do them myself. “GOOD CRM, SPEAK UP”, I remember the advice and the chat my examiner gave to me on that day, almost word for word. I also remember some time later when I was presented with the very situation and person that he fore saw that day, and my weaknesses that he could read like a book coming home to roost, now with some more miles under my wing and the help of the 737 I have read myself like a book too and know the truth just as he did then. 

I learned from him just like all my instructors here. Most will agree that I do speak up now. I speak up against a management model that unlike us with two ears and one mouth has grown two mouths and one ear. That ear is now stuck in the middle of their own un-changing voices. From there it hears only itself.

[2019-01-25 18:39:00] <fergus.cassidy> Yes, the system should be automated, it already knows the planned fuel load, the planned pax so it should give a warning to the handlers 1 hour before so can tell the crew or plan to move bags or passengers but that would require someone to do something right.

[2019-01-27 08:39:28] <johnmurray737> Morning guys. Is any one else having issues when refreshing the wx on the iPad. I was getting a TAF which was more than 24 hrs old and wouldn’t refresh to a more recent one. :thinking_face: 
[2019-01-27 08:43:01] <fergus.cassidy> It's always been like that. You don't pay for quality programming you get shite apps. 
[2019-01-27 08:43:16] <vonkm> Yes is already for 2 weeks or so. One day I was getting multiple tafs which were 4 days old. Very nasty and dangerous bug in the software 
[2019-01-27 08:51:46] <pilot> Been like that since the beginning. I have written multiple queries… “We are monitoring the problem”. Very dangerous indeed !!
Write a quick  query, otherwise ot will never get fixed 
[2019-01-27 08:55:12] <fergus.cassidy> They are probably using a free service like pilot weather which does the same thing rather than using a proper paid service, just like the oceanic tracks which are now just lat  and long coordinates.  
[2019-01-27 09:18:35] <robertgormley53> Yeh it's always happened on and off. Easily missed as well. So when we ask a dispatcher for the weather and they say 'can you not get it off your ipad?'.....  
[2019-01-27 09:51:13] <coolhand787> Well I solve that problem by taking 1.5T extra fuel due correct forecast not available and write it in CPT notes. That costs them more than the savings on free app but trying to query for me is a waste of time as RYR ‘always knows better’

[2019-01-27 17:03:21] <biondina> Flightplans have been wrong last month as well had a flight plan from MLA to CGN with a TOW of 68,3 and planned level was FL380. No way you are making that until 20 miles before TOD. Send a query and turned out there was a problem with the database. So be careful with them as well and if it doesn’t make sense send query’s to have the trend of the problem documented.

[2019-01-28 04:04:31] <kilroyrobin> It is right that you read this line and it speaks to you Stephen. You were a thread and stitch through every letter in that line in the last year. Your contribution to the council that lead to that spirit of 2018 and ‘19 is much less known to many than it is to me. Simply exceptional spirit and determination. A fast and relentless cog in our common machine of change.

[2019-01-29 08:22:41] <coolhand787> Hey Adam thanks for sharing! This must be Southwest plan! A lot got lost in MOL’s translation with his personal only goal get rich with his cronies on staff’s back! RYR is changing!  
[2019-01-29 09:20:16] <rballen> Not wishing to dampen our enthusiasm for pay rises but let’s not forget the years of poverty before even getting into Southwest for a US pilot. Decades of appallingly low pay. In Europe we can jump straight from flightschool with 150hrs into the RHS of a 737 earning £50,000 and within 3.5-4 years be in the LHS of a jet earning £130,000. Americans would argue that’s also what dreams are made of. Interesting to compare salaries across continents but the European and US markets are very different beasts.

[2019-01-29 23:06:27] <oliver> And no more qnh blunder error mitigation.... as we dont write it down anymore. Vspeeds and thrust settings are gone aswell. I believe we should keep some kind of TOLD card, just in case the FMS acts up. 
[2019-01-29 23:26:32] <healyglen> We'll post a brief update on the RTPG channel tomorrow.  
[2019-01-29 23:27:20] <jorgelucca> I use the Bug Card. Just click the 3 items before sending it. The top one says "View Bug Card". 
[2019-01-29 23:28:36] <oliver> True, but I normally leave the ipad open on my SID page. 
[2019-01-29 23:29:04] <damiano.detomassi> Bug card is amazing , but the blunder error is mitigated by having white qnh pre selected  
[2019-01-29 23:31:55] <ginosabatino> With the old version, i could select 22k manually, and see how much we could lift, especially liked doing this at shorter runways or intersection takeoffs as if you are within 1kg of the max weight under those conditions it will tell you 22k..(even when it is all assumed pax and bag weights....to many assumptions for 1kg margin for my liking!)

Now that you need to select the placard weight, it will just tell you that you can lift 66990, not that the max it can lift under those conditions and intersection is 66991kg...

So you change the placard and must enter the atis weather again...or just select the highest placard. 

Same logic for a delayed rotation, when you deleted the actual weight and entered the max possible you can lift for the latest possible Vr, now that doesnt work very well.  
[2019-01-29 23:39:17] <oliver> Not to split hairs, thought you cross checked the forcasted qnh on the bug card with atis one which was preselected.
A life ago in a Swissair flight into ZRH, we got trapped:  we both entered the told by ATC QNH of 1021 without questioning the preset 1012 ..... 
we were still on path but altitude xcheck was puzzling. We caught the mistake, and thank God it was an ILS. (edited)
[2019-01-29 23:44:50] <robertwasilewski> Good...wel it was me today...to remove all the qeustions marks before it will spread out..yes it was unfortunately after the "base" reduction meeting...but no no hard landing but it happend after take off while trying to retract the gear we got one red and one green on the left gear...and you know POISEE NITS PA and landing in HHN..it seems like we lost the part of ldg pivot (edited)

[2019-01-29 23:47:40] <thomas> I thought the crosscheck was mainly that PM pre sets the forecast QNH and the PF sets the actual QNH after getting the ATIS (officially) and then you cross check. I might very well be mistaken though.

It is satisfying to be able to do so within the confines of this audience of professionals - before it gets stuck on crew dock along with exactly how many hundred passengers were inconvenienced or some SOP/old memo for re issue that a desk jockey dug up using the luxury of hindsight, or time, and a comfy office chair complete with lumber support to mitigate lower back pain - (that being the primary threat said desk jockey faces on a daily basis) - or worse still before a grossly simplified and convenient version of events gets pedalled out on our SEP day on a 1 page version of events that is a full catalogue of errors made on the front line, but remarkably light on those mitigating circumstances where lessons on an infrastructure and culture of support within a community of consolidated experience really lie.

[2019-01-30 19:14:50] <boston58730> Floaters report to the floating standards captain who is based at Dublin HQ. If you check your email junk folder I’m sure you will find some spam with his email address on it. 
[2019-01-30 19:20:41] <oliver> Is there any specific writings about when to be at the aircraft?

I believe the only written requirement is to be at the crewroom at checkin time -45’ and “trying” to be at the acft at -25’
Because we should take only one bus per crew to remote parking or non Schengen flights, this -25 is not always attainable.
BTW  in order to be at -45 in crewroom (a must) we do meet at -60’ in front of passport control, which is about 20’ walk from the parking area.

Because of this we should get the official duty to start @-60’ and yet it is still at -45’

Today I was told that cabin crews HAVE to be at the acft @-35’ or they get in trouble, therefore if our preparation (paperwork, printers, notams, HILs, MELs fuel calculations, pilot briefing and cabin crew briefings takes more than 5’..... than I should let the entire crew go on, and finish everything on my own, than take a 100 passenger bus alone to reach the crew...... all this so that they can start boarding pax on time, and not get REPORTED by handling.

All this procedure unfortunately is done while they cant start fueling.
Now all pax are on board, but we still have to brief, start fuelling procedures, setup the rest in the cockpit, individually do the leadsheets, (all under the curious watch of seated paxs). Of course we are possibly still leaving 10’ lates, as we cant be lured into cutting corners by perceived time pressures. 
Unfortunately we know, real time passes by us inesorabily, even if we dont like it. 

So it seems to me, that we have to invent non standard procedures only to “fool” the system and avoid “reports”, as we know nothing really changes: in real life, 10’ late are 10’ late!!!

Where are we going, is this really necessary??!!!


Other issue I have personally witnessed is cabin crews coming to work sick because they are afraid to get in trouble. They will call in sick only during the turnaround and go home, just so that management has no excuses to repremend them. 
In a particular case, the stand by cabin crew shows up and she says she was sorry, was sick all night but didnt call sick while on standby, afraid to get in trouble, she promises she can do her work safely, but had to visit the restroom many times during the flight.

When will management finally understand that we are human, we are professionals and are not here to create absenteism.... just for the fun of it? 
That implementing this culture of fear will eventually cause serious if not catastrophic problems?

[2019-01-30 19:50:12] <andy.airamerica> In Dublin we are expected to be on the aircraft at -35 (edited)
[2019-01-30 19:52:12] <andy.airamerica> They don’t say which 9 months either. 
[2019-01-30 20:06:41] <bkehoe00> I believe the term is ‘optimised reporting’ that went around around 3 or 4 years ago changing reporting procedures and it gradually got introduced in various bases before becoming standard procedure. Cabin crew check in -45, leave crew room at -40 and complete their briefing on the aircraft as gops always have rear steps and GPU provided (in the dub hq fantasy world). When this change in procedure came in they were being told camera footage would be reviewed to ensure they left crew rooms no later than -40. On aircraft at -35 (including for us); I’ve had Swissport trying to put delays on the crew for being late at aircraft for not being on at -35.

[2019-01-30 20:15:32] <pilot> Speaking of  the MXP -60 rule, I completely agree.
You guys MUST be at the passport control at -60, dictated by the company, but your duty starts 15mins later ? Cannot imagine that being legal.

[2019-01-30 20:29:29] <ginosabatino> And just remember, we all ready do 11months full time, and with the adhoc days thats about 10.3 months, at full time pay, or take 75% pay and work your :peanuts:off for 9 months.. 
[2019-01-30 20:32:51] <bkehoe00> Do you have the original memos Bob? I was in a trial base at the time and it was either in those memos or what was put up on crew room briefing stations, I can’t remember. Think 2015 period. (edited)
[2019-01-30 20:36:08] <brendanjacobs> That explains why the dispatcher in SXF assigned delay 63 when I was out of base there recently. :face_with_rolling_eyes:. Another thing that can happen. In everyone’s haste to get out to the aircraft and start boarding, nobody checks to see where the aircraft arrived from before leaving the crew room. The first chance is when the captain checks the tech log. Boarding has already started and now comes the realisation that a search should have been done and not just a check because the aircraft came in from Marrakesh!

[2019-01-30 21:40:15] <masterharkin> I remember something that said crew should be at the aircraft no later than 20 mins before departure. 
	:point_up: jonathantaylor33
[2019-01-30 21:41:58] <jonathantaylor33> It used to be written in Ops A that the reporting point would be positioned as to allow crew to be at aircraft at no less than STD -20. But of course that has disappeared.

As per Ops A pg 7-12 , " Where any element of the 45 minute report is Challenged as reported by aircrew or detected from punctuality data, the 45 minute report and/or non regulatory procedures will be changed to ensure continued compliance"!! 

In other words guys, this stuff has to be reported and if its falling on deaf ears just take your time, take the delay, and await for them to be crucified by the on time stats which seem so dear to them! Ignore base information which are fiction not fact!!

[2019-01-30 22:05:15] <joshuabowers1> If -5 is to be, then an on time departure is going to be entirely dependent on landing early from previous sector to get out on time.

To give an example, a couple days ago we get into Lviv. Already running a couple mins late so no fat to spare. So once techlog is done I’m outside to inspect the flaps for contamination before retracting to up. Then check the aircraft itself and make a decision on de-icing. Complete a walk around and oh...operate the fuelling panel as the local fuellers aren’t qualified (paid)? to flick 3 switches.

Back into the flight deck with a techlog to fill out for the next sector, de-icing form to get prepped, RIBETS, normal and de icing before engine start checklists, PA, OPT W+B. (Still on the original iPad and can take up to 10 seconds to move between tabs/ text fields!)

Of course with Winter Ops an on time departure has never been realistic but it just goes to show that even with de-icing on stand we were still completing the OPT after de-icing finished. Even when the dispatcher was clicking away on the headset trying to announce his presence.

Oh and then realising that because only 3 pax were allocated to the FWD cabin we needed to move some pax for trim. Unfortunately at that point the FD door is locked and crew are already doing their safety demo. :neutral_face: (edited)
[2019-01-30 22:11:25] <jonathantaylor33> Is that an old version of the Ops A steve? Because it would be useful to quote in any reports or to throw back at any irate dispatchers:grin: 
[2019-01-30 22:15:50] <kilroyrobin> 25%!! That’s even more than the 7% Norwegian pay cut that we keep being told about - even though I’ve had direct confirmation that this cut is simply not happening in any part of the Norwegian operation - anywhere - except in that parallel dimension of un-paralleled crayon creativity a little closer to home where words are employed solely in so far as they may used in the deliverance of profit rather than even so much as a slight bias or lean towards the truth, or anything even relating to it. It’s all quite funny, in that sinister and un funny way of the bully boy, because if by contrast you develop an equal but opposite reputation for deliverance on your word as your bond and a reflection of your decency and respect, then the money follows by default rather than by deceit (ain’t that right Herb!) (edited)
[2019-01-30 22:26:24] <masterharkin> Yeah 2014 
[2019-01-30 22:50:00] <kilroyrobin> Oliver that is a very well written description of the disillusionment that people start to feel when you are simply given more to do than can be done in the time allotted, and then you find yourself reported for it. *At some point you feel the manual is not being written to keep you out of trouble but to get you in to it* Year on year more and more of what is prescribed as ‘company law’ simply does not fit into the length of time given to the task. Then you are told the time pressure is ‘perceived’. Yay, so that’s what ‘you’ got wrong too. Personally I love efficiency, I hate waste, I shut down a GPU when I lock up, I get my kicks out of energy management, it’s poetry in motion to me, CDA’s too, and getting a crew to play to win is always a pleasure, I love all that, but there is a realisation coming down the tracks that we simply cannot achieve the targets set in this game anymore, and that spoils the game. What’s the point in kicking a ball into a goal that is thinner than the ball itself. What’s the point?! Now when people start saying ‘what is the point?’ then management have lost it, what is worse though is this. Once people start to see the company law book as ‘bad law’ or impossible to achieve.. just written to hang you.. etc, then you unfortunately have no law. Aviation is not the place for no law, or for making it up as you go along because you have come to know that the book is impossible. Only a bean counter could buy that as good aviation strategy, or perhaps a pilot who spent more time counting Beans than counting the jobs he was shoving endlessly into a 25 minute turnaround. I love all the ever increasing checks and cross checks, independently verify this and that, all fed in around the SMS data loop back to us, capturing mistakes, synergy in the crew, but until they work out a time warp, none of this works out in fact. All that SMS data is wasted in this race. All you get is rimed responses, fatigue, task saturation and an unexpected config alert - if you’re so lucky. (edited)

[2019-01-31 07:26:52] <fergus.cassidy> Don't hand over that LID till the electronic loadsheet is in trim and signed, same as the old paper loadsheet, the dispatcher wouldn't hand over the paper one till it was in trim. Their problem for not giving the same software to the gate staff to give a check before boarding commences with the original load. Give them the block fuel and trip and problem solved. 
[2019-01-31 08:25:25] <fergus.cassidy> Robert, well done, it's your sort of professionalism that makes us proud. That moment when landing not knowing if the gear will remain locked is not the nicest, I've been there. But you did your crew and passengers proud. My first thought was maintenance. Everything is so rushed these days, you never know what's missed during maintenance checks. But we're here as the final check, correcting others errors and mistakes, whether it be management or ATC.

[2019-01-31 10:50:39] <boswellbrown> In BRS some moons ago, I put in a query regards the -45 in relation to actual times it takes to physically walk to the ac. Now I know this query landed on a certain deputy chief pilots desk... to date he has failed to give a written response. I understand a former colleague queried the IAA and never even got an acknowledgement. At a base meeting I challenged Ray Conway on both the -45 report and 25 min turnaround. He tried to defend -25 but admitted he knew no one who reports at -45. “It’s just the way it is”... When neither the Chief pilot or IAA can be asked one does wonder who’s really running the show?

[2019-02-01 12:23:41] <bkehoe00> Thought this was a joke when I started reading the memo. :joy: They should just enable FaceTime voice on the iPad 3G at least.  
[2019-02-01 12:38:30] <andy.airamerica> Do I understand that they want us to use our own personal Skype accounts for this?  
[2019-02-01 12:39:52] <stephenmjacob14> That's what I took from that Andy. :see_no_evil: 
[2019-02-01 12:55:05] <ginosabatino> They could activate facetime on the ipad and let us use that to call...

Oh wait, that would cost them money.  
[2019-02-01 13:01:00] <andy.airamerica> I haven’t put the IDP on my own personal mobile phone. I won’t be using my own personal Skype account for work either.  
[2019-02-01 13:18:47] <coolhand787> Same here Andy. Using IDP and SKYPE on my personal device makes me a slave of RYR callable at my expense any time RYR wants it and is convenient to them. I read the latest IDP memo.... as far as I am concerned the only way to communicate with crews is the one illustrated and IAA approved in OM A. Once an FCI is issued and IDP with clear guidelines is added to OM A then we all have protection. Otherwise RYR will use and abuse this to their advantage. They way I understood the first memo of IDP it was recommended by Ray, now in the latest IDP memo you must... since when is a non OM A procedure mandatory?  
[2019-02-01 14:08:48] <coolhand787> It’s like Robin said elsewhere in a post. RYR is run by bean counters don’t see the end off their nose..

[2019-02-01 14:20:12] <andy.airamerica> I thought the same André from the latest IDP memo. I got the impression that it was being implied and assumed that this was now compulsory.

[2019-02-01 14:33:10] <joshuabowers1> Had to contact Flt Planning today in Amman, they have a phone that they bring out from their office to contact dub ops. So they brought that to the flight deck and we used that. No chance I’m paying £5 per minute to call from Jordan.

This plan is also nonsensical because it’ll cost just as much to make a VOIP data call over 3G from there too! (edited)

[2019-02-01 15:25:58] <coolhand787> Correct Josh. Same goes for Morocco, TGD in Montenegro etc! RYR is just trying to pass the buck onto someone else ! I went AOG in TGD and called from the tower. Took an extra 10’ each way so be it. Any normal company has a dedicated phone or ACARS on their aircraft. Had RYR spent less millions on union busters and invest more into their workforce then the phone issue would have been virtually for free... AGB

[2019-02-01 15:32:48] <coolhand787> As Andy correctly stated, RYR like to imply it is mandatory when it is not! We all must be very careful and remain vigilant about this IDP stuff. RYR is trying to force this really powerful manipulation tool onto us without any oversight by the IAA nor any ‘rules of engagement’ like in OM A. And we know already how much they bend the rules with OM A. So imagine with IDP, Pilots and Cabin crew will be fair game to shoot on sight! Any Ideas on how to harness this dragon ?

If I was MOL, I would dangle it in front of us as a decoy and distraction for the unions to go after. 

We need to keep our eyes on the prize. 
[2019-02-01 20:26:12] <julien.benazzi> They wont train dispatchers to do RFS according to Andy Oshea yesterday. They aim to train fuellers accross the network to do the job. Like in ireland and lithuania at the moment they said.  
[2019-02-01 21:56:51] <bkehoe00> BUD has just been added to RFS list as it happens. So just 217 airports left.

[2019-02-02 01:35:35] <matthewwilson> Today we set up for a 69990 departure... Performance done. Then, LMC, reset, change to 66990, new performance done, weight change to 66990. Confirm cabin zones, they didn't match. Head count. Wrong by 2 adults, now need to go back to 69990. Eventually plus 1 adult. Remain at 66990.

Sector 2. Performance carried out for standard runway. Upon asking for startup,  runway changed to parralel. New performance carried out. Engines started. Requested taxi. Runway change again, back to original. 3x performance emails sent.

Living the dream. Another code 62! (edited)
[2019-02-02 07:00:08] <samdunlopis> Code 62 is getting a good work out. But as an explanation I’m using RFS. Anyone else? 
[2019-02-02 07:21:30] <sam.vanherzele> Facetime is actually enabled on our efb's. Even on 3g. They just have to give us the account details to call ops with it.  
[2019-02-02 08:20:59] <fergus.cassidy> Mixed between RFS and late LID. Explained in the notes section. LiD not handed over till loadsheet filled and in trim. Also headcount confirmed too. 
[2019-02-02 08:32:13] <kilroyrobin> I agree on the fuel supervision. It is the root cause of time shortage to a large extent.

[2019-02-02 08:46:47] <tomflood737> I’m happy to hear someone else is asking for a full headcount when the forward and aft zones don’t match. I’ve wondered  if any else was insisting on it as I always seem to have to explain the requirement to the No.1. 

Have had several errors lately with the incorrect total onboard. 

Although if the error is in the middle, you’ll never know.  
[2019-02-02 10:13:57] <ginosabatino> What i have noticed on many flights, is the despatcher tells the n1 how many are in the front and the back, and they dont actually count themselves!

The process should change where by they are not told, and that will force them to count the front and back.  
	:+1: samkettle16, tuhhodge, jgrooney, apfoley
[2019-02-02 10:29:36] <kilroyrobin> Exactly, I recently asked the No.1 for the headcount for the front and back 5 rows and he says while pointingat the departing dispatcher (and I quote l) “he didn’t tell me” 
[2019-02-02 10:49:07] <boston58730> That is something that really pisses me off. I’m waiting there for the LID and those guys are talking to the No1 about where pax are sitting.

If it’s out of trim, we have to move them anyway so why not do that briefing on the way out of the FD instead of the way in. 
[2019-02-02 10:56:06] <padibartolomeo> RFS is theoretically not mandatory , so one way to avoid rushing through the performance set up would be to avoid RFS, and spare 5, 10 mins for a much more important and safety related task . And if one happens to be late , use 62 . 
[2019-02-02 11:27:08] <jolmervanbrakel> Exactly Serks and Robin, for confirmation bias and time saving, the dispatcher should stop telling the nr1 how many in the front and back. Have them do a count and crosscheck with us.  
[2019-02-02 12:23:11] <matthewwilson> Every time the zones don't match, I ask the no.1, "did you move the passengers or did they move themselves?"
If they moved themselves, I get a headcount. But, it only works whilst no.1's don't get wise to the question. 
New question, "did you actually do the headcount yet?" Classic answer the other day was "yes." Next I hear the interphone chime and the number 2 calling to give the headcount from the back. :zipper_mouth_face:

Any doubt, headcount. I'm amazed how often they're wrong. I think at least 1/10 is wrong. I'd hate to speculate how high that number could be given that mostly, I don't do a headcount. (edited)

[2019-02-02 20:46:18] <swfmcmanus> Had 1 pax today BRS DUB, empty holds. Loadsheet was out of the envelope by 25kg. Options was ballast (25kg) which the airport had or use 3/3 for crew instead of 2/4. Which we ended up using. 

Just a heads up for anyone in future. 

Ops put me through to the duty pilot and I got written approval to move the numbers around on the off chance someone in an office somewhere wouldn't like it. 
---------------
Also, it was DUB BRS KUN and back, plenty of delays. The duty start time was changed to 10 mins later and our flights were completely changed around to make our delays seem minimal with just long turnaround times.

End of day EFL didn't match the voyage report we left off with. I changed the report times to original times and made a note. 

Anyone had this before?

[2019-02-04 09:26:33] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FFX1H4XD2 with text: 6 years ago Facebook tells me I posted this picture expressing my concern at the growing brain drain that the bean counters would use to sell large chunks of our safety margins for profit. The picture courted only one comment by reply. Too scared? Not interested? Or maybe just nobody got it, after all it is a bit subtle. It’s subtle because big brother had already hauled me in to the office to reprimand me for another post of equally subtle hints. Shopped by a colleague - bazaar isn’t it. I was using a foolish conduit for my fears of course, but now we have Slack where we have an audience of qualified privilege to voice our valid concerns. I’m proud that the Ryanair pilots themselves were finally the ones that gave a voice to this concern, and by their marching support they brought a route towards its solution. A route to a consolidation of this airline into a place where people and experience are valued, where staff will stay on and where they will form part of a culture of experience that will ultimately cradle those who naturally replace us in time rather than the bean counters dream of endless fountains of Pilots being spat out of a production line to sink or swim. The responsibility on which a pilot achieves, sink or swim, of course falls entirely upon the commander because he was trained to “absolute proficiency”. That kind of ‘hand washing’ language of absolution is enough for bean counters to feel responsible to profit but yet not responsible to accident or incident. Clever isn’t it, except it’s bullshit. Any fully functioning mind knows that if your finger prints form any part of our model then you are responsible in both profit and in loss, loss in all its forms. Aviation is not short of ways to bring loss in all forms, and when it comes it is not limited in blame to the signature in the tech log. It belongs in some way to any of us who ever touched this whole thing. Pilots should now be proud as hell to be in a position in 2019 to shape this airline in a way we can stand over. No point expecting bean counters to have a conscience for they are well practiced in the art of the slopey shoulder. They just count beans, we on the other hand count much much more, by choice and by our profession we are accountable. In 2019 we choose to live up to that again. How ridiculous a distortion of realities is it that many Pilots still function as if more afraid of running into HR than running into the bloody ground. In grit and determination we now hold our ground for our profession, for our passengers, for our colleagues, and to replace fear in mind with peace of mind, and in turn a clear mind so that we may just go and do our job.  Our job is to fly safe.

[2019-02-04 21:56:28] <albertbessler> Anybody know how to getting a police Cert. from Ireland for the company ID? I don’t have an airport ID , as I’m based in Spain. The Garda vetting has to be run through the BC Dublin to get an invite to apply for Garda vetting and it seems you can’t apply yourself for a police check.  
[2019-02-04 22:17:17] <andy.airamerica> I think you can apply for Garda vetting yourself on the Garda website. But as you say it probably all must be done via the BC.

[2019-02-05 23:44:12] <remco.spelt> We are very busy here in SEPLA for the last week, we have requested Ryanair to move the deadline, we do everything we can in our power using all of our free time to gather information discuss options and get legal advise... but we had like 1 week until deadline of base transfer requests (which is soon) and another until they execute them (that's 2 weeks from moment of base meeting till end).

But we have hope and so should all of you, we achieved already so much together. You can never get everyone involved in slack or in the union but the people who are active they can make the difference, make noise correct any false propaganda by Ryanair etc. 

Summer is coming so will be more problems for Ryanair.... Keep believing (edited)

[2019-02-06 00:57:14] <andy.airamerica> What did you expect from the rest of the pilot body when they closed EIN? Did you expect the rest of europe to not show up for work the next day in protest? It is not as easy as that. Industrial relations do not work like that. There are procedures and laws to follow. I think you’ll find there was words of protests from other bases and member associations that supported you. Letters were sent from different MAs. People being sent oob in winter without protesting? When has protesting going oob ever gotten anybody anywhere in this fight? It’s a waste of time and resources. How do you think that phonecall goes when you call rostering or crew control to complain or to say no? You get accused of refusing to carry out your duties. How does that help your case? There are bigger issues to solve and it is no good if the people who are fighting are taken off the pitch because of being in HQ for a disciplinary meeting.

[2019-02-06 07:01:34] <tomisalon> Expressing opinions are part of our freedom they don’t always match with your point of view but nevertheless are they wrong. Everyone should have their right to say what they think isn’t that why we have this platform? My point of view agrees what has been said this fight is coming to an end and RYR has already conquered more than us. What have we really accomplished in these 1.5 years? Union recognition, seniority list in UK and Ireland?
What have they accomplished in same time, divided Ryanair for 4 companies, closed multiple bases, made Pilots reductant while hiring thousands of new and they haven’t signed any deals considering terms and conditions. What I see is many losing their hope for improvements and jumping out from this sinking boat while Ryanair takes in new fresh blood who are happy as they came from worse conditions that we currently have. Sending letters to HQ from my point of view is same as police sending letter to criminals if they don’t stop then we will stop investigating. Looking back in the past after strikes in Ireland they informed of pilots to be moved to Poland for which other unions answered by making support strike, when the same happened to Germany and Netherlands nobody did anything, isn’t that a fact? For the work done in background isn’t rule for leading to be part of the team,to be visible, to interact so you can keep motivation alive along your workers? If I remember correctly by 31st of January we were supposed to have local contracts since we are now in February I think that has been either forgotten or moved forward?

This is my opinion of where are we now.

WELL, YES GODDAMNIT! 
Not the "next day" ofcourse but at least some unified strong answer. I can remember when the DUB pilots were threatened to be made redundant, lots of countries stood up and announced actions. Is it naïeve to say we expected the same from the rest?
When I cried for help here I was told "the timing is not right, and retaliation for what happened in EIN/BRE will come". In my point of view it's rather a fact that nothing happened than a feeling.
I still appreciate the hard work done by all CC and the hard work still going on, let's get that fact straight. And I still wear my yellow lanyard with proud.
@andy.airamerica, you may call me pessimistic and defeatist. But remember, you still have a job and see you family everyday.

[2019-02-06 07:16:17] <swfmcmanus> I spoke with one of our council members recently and got a better insight into what is happening on the RTPG level. I'm not worried about the level of work or commitment being put in by them and I have a greater understanding as a result. 

That being said, things have gotten very quiet outside of the councils and unions. Crews working on the front line, including myself, like to see action more than words. (edited)

[2019-02-06 09:34:59] <boston58730> It’s a tricky and fine line to walk. We must be covert in our actions so that the company cannot anticipate and outflank us, and yet we need to keep the membership involved.

The line pilots growing temperament to strike is well noted by the C.C’s and provides motivation to keep moving forward. It’s a fact that long and dirty background battles will occur over this year in the background, but the overall plan of war to end the tyranny for us line pilots to take action must be kept secret . We must trust in the process and when action does occur , the Shareholders will sit up this time when the “real” truth outs and they’ll have a good clear out . My heart goes out to all those and their families affected by the ongoing so called “commercially driven decisions” by mngt and this can never be excused . It’s been ongoing degradation of t’s and c’s since 2000. It’s always been the go to style of holding onto for dear life , an outdated low cost model that once worked  . It’s like as if no other strategy is known now in hq. Time for a re-education but everything must be legally watertight . Otherwise the Ryr lawyers will have a field day, mngt will play the being bullied game to draw up more support from shareholders etc. Change will come when the final plan will be released . We must support each other in the meantime while the CC’s work arduously on our behalf for our futures . Unity :muscle::alarm_clock::reminder_ribbon: (edited)

[2019-02-06 09:46:14] <ledwithcolin> Base closures and downsizing are exactly the reason we need agreements in place.  They are for the bad times and the good.  This will always happen in an airline with 80 plus bases.  I would have loved to have gone on strike to support our colleagues in EIN but to do so would have been illegal and we would have commuted union suicide by doing so.  Gone would be any hope for the future.

I also have an opinion that many may disagree with but I don't believe unions can or should be able to dictate where the company bases it's aircraft.  It is vitally important though that agreements are in place to make sure transfers are done fairly and not on company terms like we saw in EIN.

[2019-02-06 13:49:05] <rballen> I was just wondering what the unions’ thoughts are on report times of STD-45 mins? We all know report times of 45 mins are inadequate for proper pre-flight planning particularly with winter ops, inexperienced crew members, 4 sectors and any MEL items. It has been brushed under the carpet for years by both Ryanair and the IAA and remarks on Crewdock talk about time pressure being ‘perceived’. Duty time limits are a safety issue and if crew feel under pressure to report well before their official report time then those safety margins are being reduced. Particularly concerning are bases where ‘meeting’ points / times are documented as well in excess of STD-45 mins due to crew transport etc. yet Ryanair won’t move on it. How much longer should we let the company and regulator get away with this? Is this something unions can help with in terms of applying pressure to the regulator?

[2019-02-06 13:58:20] <damiano.detomassi> Battling about it for months . Ryanair management  consider to sell their mother before giving up the greatest advantage they have over the competition , infact cheating the system . TXL FRA and MXP case come to mind . (edited)
[2019-02-06 14:03:23] <samdunlopis> It’s a very good point. A one hour sign on would be  much better but this has been a sticking point for the 15 or so years I’ve been here. 
[2019-02-06 14:08:20] <ginosabatino> The only way it will change is if we all turn up at -45, and if there are complications, mels, no printers etc and take a delay if we need, to mitigate any perceived time pressure. 

This would be especially damaging on long tight 4 sector days. Discretion reports will go up, they will need more standbys to breakup 4 sector days, it would cause them a real problem... 
[2019-02-06 14:22:07] <brendanjacobs> As long as the official record shows there is no impact on the operation using a 45’ report, nothing will change. Statistically it works. Very hard for any council members or union official to argue against Ryanair’s stats. That’s what the regulator relies on. Now if everyone suddenly started reporting no earlier than -45, then you might start changing those stats. I’m not suggesting that’s what people do, but if they did.....

[2019-02-07 13:43:02] <coolhand787> Yes Enda this is a true fact and with CLA in Belgium should allow for paid maternity leave according to local law. I think for our fellow female aviators this is a very important issue which, especially as contractor will leave you out in the cold in case of pregnancy! It is important to step forward and protect also our lady pilots! One more thing to be included in CLAs across our network! (edited)
[2019-02-07 13:46:18] <boston58730> Signed it. But bear in mind the better maternity rights are, the less favourably companies will look on female applicants.

We should follow Scandinavian law and make equal provisions for mothers and fathers thereby negating the whole women/children issue.

[2019-02-07 17:45:01] <coolhand787> Correct Jessica remember that many management pilots in DUB HQ are ex Irish Aircorps and some of them are quite detached from lady pilots and maternity! So educated they need to be.  
[2019-02-07 23:23:55] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FG2F39U95 with text: This picture tells it all. Absence from the family home is at times a necessity, sometimes answering the commercial need of a company you wish to flourish, sometimes a longer term personal return, a future security, a rewarding career, sometimes answering a commercial need within a family, sometimes just the result of decisions born of a personal innocence of what parenting would bring when it arrived - the results of any of which may often painfully ripple on until they can be resolved. But these reasons are all borne of either innocence or balanced personal or family assessment. In every parents mind there is a universal and fundamental drive to address the need to limit absence from the home and so maintain a happy and flourishing home. What more human, even mammal, instinct do any of us answer to than this. How bazaar then to think that we may walk past another on the street who is apparently at peace with closing a base in what a judge found was by means of retaliation for exercising a right which didn’t suit another’s profit ideal. I find it quite bazaar that anyone could go home after a day delivering an EIN styled retribution, then put the feet up amongst their own people and all the while be at peace with themselves for a good day’s work or a good life being lived. Someone does. Someone out there doesn’t though. Someone in that realm is on the fringe and not blind to the light of day. Those people must be the future of this company. Those who can weave balance into our current mess must be here. I hope our next tier of leaders will stand ground for both a companies life blood need for profit along with every persons fundamental need for fairness. It’s no secret that this tight rope, if you can walk it, brings reward on any level you care to measure it.

[2019-02-08 06:31:08] <jessica.emurphy2009> Its a fact of life women have the children. 
We have so many obstacles to jump over and extra choices to make just because if this.
We loose out on pay as we can’t fly while pregnant .
Given ground duties even though our license are valid to fly but we are not allowed by the company, If we want to get sector pay/are entitled to it if we are an employee,which is calculated from your previous 12 weeks flying, and if that happens just after the slow winter schedule we’ll then that’s tough.
Maternity benefits depending on the country/company/contracts/employee are not great.
We have to retrain when returning to work.
What if we don’t have family support where we are based/ didn’t manover ourselves to the one we wanted which may take time/ one that is available in the network.
Working our roster with a new baby is hard even harder for women as it’s the mother who is the main career for young children. 
That’s just another fact/ and I’m not disrespecting any of the guys who put in the hours also.
I was based on STN when I had both mine my first I left with my family in DUB at 6mts the second at 8mts it was not an easy decision but that’s just how it was. 
I had choices to make both financially and career wise ie command to get home to my children.
I’m not giving out or moaning about my choices I’m just trying to share some of the barriers that women in aviation have especially in this company. 
That’s why we have so few women especially mothers in this company.

[2019-02-08 07:01:23] <jessica.emurphy2009> Exactly Damiano, if there was better attitude towards women having kids and careers and pay then family life would be easier as then financial burden wouldn’t be put on one person ie men also options for fathers to be more involved when needed and when they want.

[2019-02-08 09:30:27] <matthewwilson> As a father-to-be, I've been disgusted by Ryanairs response to Paternity leave. However, I have a partner who can take care of the baby and allow us to keep going. 

Maternity leave for the mother's is a nightmare that needs resolving. Babies need mother's, economies need babies, babies need stability and strength, especially in those fragile early months. I didn't realise how low the allocation of maternity leave is for pilots. I'm ashamed. 

As for the base situation, I cant imagine how any airline, company or human being could allow such a situation. Thanks for sharing this; let's fight for immediate change!

[2019-02-12 09:32:55] <kilroyrobin> I love being part of a successful efficient no BS company. I like productivity in myself and those around me, I don’t like entitled layabouts, though I haven’t met any here in a very long time. However, studies of successful businesses the world over show that if things are poorly managed then a good set of key components can easily be tipped way beyond their optimal stress profile by the demoralising behaviour of a Person In Greeds Service, hereafter known as *PIGS* - oh now there’s a lucky acronym that fits the old analogy we were all raised on, anybody remember Animal Farm? PIGS do things like pick on individuals to scare the masses, pick on a base to scare the masses and other trough munching mud nuzzling behaviour such as our childhood stories told us happened when the pigs took over at animal farm. Inspired leadership is the opposite. Inspired leadership is what is needed to consolidate a formula that built success into a formula that will keep success. In my view inspired leadership is a whole lot to do with going back to the village that raised you in the mindset you employ. Whatever your mother told you about what is right and what is wrong is just as true today as it was then and people will follow it, as they did then. The village that raised you respected each other because they needed each other and they understood that. They supported each other because they knew they could also lean on each other. They probably didn’t call it synergy, but they understood synergy. This company needs to become a village again before it can ever hold ground as the great city it should be.

[2019-02-22 10:03:54] <johnfaessel> Need some advice:

I send a query, I send email to the EFB department but no reply a week later. 

Got the new Ipad last week and all went well with the set up with the exception of the OPT APP. 
Not able to update to the latest version of the OPT 4.40 and I am guessing because my IOS version is the old one 11.1 and not allowed to update it since the only one available now is the 12.1.4. 
Any advice?  
[2019-02-22 10:10:52] <gmulcair99> I had the same problem - rang the Ryanair HQ number - there is an option for EFB. 
They told me OPT 4.40 will only load with new iOS - as Apple give no option to load the previous iOS versions they told me to load the new iOS 12.1.4. 
Once it loaded the OPT 4.40 becomes available. 
[2019-02-22 10:13:25] <spac> The power of #Slack, again! 
[2019-02-22 10:15:38] <johnfaessel> Ok Gerard! I will go ahead and load iOS 12.1.4. Many thanks.  
[2019-02-22 10:25:42] <johnfaessel> I sometimes wonder what their strategy is?

*Are they trying to worn out the Unions?

*Have they not been aware that they will have to go by the rules after having signed with the union?

*They are just ignorant and think that they can continue doing things the way the have always done?

[2019-02-23 18:07:04] <kilroyrobin> Many Cadets have been assigning leave on off days during training so that they will be left with nothing when they qualify, I also flew with Cadets who were being offered a contract below what they were offered during recruitment.

[2019-02-23 18:57:43] <tuhhodge> I think it's more the case that these cadets are joining Ryanair to get the ball rolling while they wait for their preferred choice employer's slower recruitment system to get into gear. They can do this because the upfront costs of joining FR no longer make a short period of employment off-putting? 
[2019-02-23 19:12:16] <damiano.detomassi> I agree with Tom. And that makes lots of ATOs happy. The APS concept brings cash to instructor and training centers , whatever the cadets decides .  
[2019-02-23 19:44:38] <ginosabatino> True, but they are bonded as far as I am aware, so leaving will incur a cost, unless they are hoping ryr dont persue/find them. 

Such a shame they put all this hot air in pointless threatening memos, penny pinching ways to save a hundred quid on a cadet contract but then lose them in 6 months costing god knows how much in fees to cae to recruit and effort on training department to train...if only that effort went into making the company the company and career of choice! 

Not everyone will want to stay, many want to fly long haul, live in exotic sounding places (not Marrakech...!), but surely they must understand that when most cadets join that they already have one eye on the exit, something is seriously wrong.  
[2019-02-23 20:40:37] <tomflood737> As a trainer it is disheartening to hear that so many leave after putting so much energy into training what could be the future of Ryanair. 

Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity springs to mind.

[2019-02-24 19:29:55] <coolhand787> Have you been called by the BC or Duty Pilot just after your flight to ask why you had DLY 63? The new LID/ELS electronic loadsheet is causing RYR a great deal of delays. This last block of 5 I received 2 emails to explain ELS DLY 63 and on my last day, literally 5 min after going on chocks sector 4 I got a call from duty pilot who, very politely I must say, asked me the reason for DLY63. He did ask if we came too late to a/c which I refuted immediately. I explained the following: “DLY 63 was due to following new Electronic Load Sheet procedure, accurately and without any perceived time pressure, with flight safety as our main concern.” I stated the same in my email response. Tested, with time check, following ELS takes if all data corresponds 5-6min. This of course if you don’t slip up or down on MTOW. Then double this value! I could imagine that the ELS DLY 63 is a major headache for the company. Yet I explained that an incorrect ZFW or wrong selection of THR 22k instead of 26k and short RWY could result in a tail strike/late rotation due incorrect performance. You are going left and right and up and down following SOP! To this arguments the DP admitted ELS procedure cumbersome and in need for a rework. Bottom line, I will make the DLY 63 until I am godam good and happy all data is correct, WITHOUT any perceived time pressure! Cos in case of mistake this falls back on yours truly! So cover your six and Happy Landings

[2019-02-25 01:43:31] <bkehoe00> 62 is for calculations of the OPT, fuelling supervision, etc so I’m not surprised that 63 is flagging up on their radar.  
[2019-02-25 06:09:16] <janssonda> Delay codes 63, 64, 65 are checked in detail and needs to be explained on the weekly BC report as far as I’m aware. 
[2019-02-25 06:41:05] <biondina> And all delay of 4 min and under don’t need a explanation from the dispatcher. After that it always needs to be explained.  
[2019-02-25 07:10:39] <coolhand787> The DLY Code list Damiano provided is different from that provided by RYR iPad in Documents/Operational/IATA Delay codes. According to memo and request from BC DLY 63 should be used for ELS issues. As Daniel correctly advised DLY 63=&gt;65 need explanation on CPT Remarks. If 62 is used the impact of ELS delays may be diluted by RFS/APU etc. I know RYR is chasing DLYs already now/winter low season as IMHO I think they are still extremely tight on crews/hours and want to anticipate/alleviate ‘wasting’ crew hours for the summer/rest of the year.

[2019-02-25 07:16:35] <coolhand787> As Tom said I think it is a scandal that all our very hard working, very competent and dedicated  LTCs get used and abused by RYR who are incapable of creating a stable/retention work environment. RYR boasts about hiring 1100 pilots in 2017 and same 2028! They should be ashamed of themselves, this is a replacement of close to 50% of the pilot workforce in 2 years!!! Make RYR an airline where you can and are willing to make a career for Christ’s sake!

This is far more valuable than money, but yet they play our families as pawns on a very black and white board played solely for profit and loss in a total and careless ignorance of the real cost. 

When we fought back on mass they picked on a smaller target, and took from them instead. This is the mark of the bully. I cannot truly enjoy my place at home while there is a mark on another’s family now, an ‘empty chair’ at their family table. The ‘empty chair’ at the family table is a manipulation, it is contrived and a sinister mechanism employed here for decades now in order to generate fear and a foul profit instead of an honest one, as will otherwise exist when we are done. 

This fight is not just for the one who’s chair is empty and now must raise a family on Skype, but also for everyone who is part of what should be the wider family of Ryanair employees, and their families too. All seasons pass, but this is the spring of 2019. In the spring of 2019 we must decide. We have the power now, but not forever. We forget this now only as a pack of fools. 

We have to decide if we accept the management ethos who’s power is built on the ‘empty chair’. The only reason it exists is that it has unfortunately found it’s roots beside a quiet pool of acceptance, but if we accept what happened in EIN, BRE &amp; NRN then we are party to the crime. We are guilty as the aggressor but yet we will pay as the victim. 

Acceptance here is lose lose for us. In the spring of 2019 we must stand for a clear and transparent base closure protocol at a transnational level, and recover all else that has been stolen, or else we must accept the ‘empty chair’ and the great decline it has been proved to bring, a decline which is immediate for some but long term for all. 

Ultimately, if we do not stand we must accept that the ‘empty chair’ could be yours and even if it isn’t, the guilt will be for the ostriches to bear - as we know the pigs will feel no guilt. If pilots now choose to build on the foundations of 2018, in 2019, no one can doubt their position of power, but with power comes responsibility. 

From a position of power the acceptance of a crime is the same as a tacit approval of the crime. I for one do not accept the empty chair where it’s origins are less than a clear, transparent and fair commercial reality. 

Beside the idle pond it is more than the willows that will weep if we accept the puppet strings of this unethical perversion of modern social and economic values. Our hours of genuine labour may be bought and sold for profit, that is the life we know and accept, but our families are not pawns to be fed upon for another man’s billion. There we draw the line.

[2019-02-25 11:50:00] <timkuijpers> I've had the pleasure of a verbally aggresive BC regarding DLY63 recently too. (First time I used it btw) Me and FO Both on day 1 show op 46min prior to departure, me having checked WX and NOTAM on the way in. Navtech update 40mb, and email stating docunet app had to be updated urgently. With a Mobile phone this should take 5 minutes nowadays, but the lowcost wifi in the crewroom needed around 25min!!  I left the FO in the crewroom and headed to the aircraft and started 13t fuel uplift.. no boarding of course. Followed by lack of information regarding INAD passenger we left about half an hour late. No time pressure perceived of course. The phone call(s) came early next day in my rest period.

I was asked why I didn't update the iPad at home. I told him I hadn't been home in a while since Ryanair hasnt been able to base me there :joy: My main reason is that they blame us if we get sick on a 5/4 roster, but meanwhile expect us to do this stuf in our off time. 

If Ryanair shows no mercy in blaming us whenever we break procedures, then I'm just playing their game and stick to their procedures. When it doesn't work, it somehow still is my fault :thinking_face:

[2019-02-25 12:46:12] <damiano.detomassi> i hear you . 
[2019-02-25 12:57:47] <coolhand787> Tim you are right on the money! Apply their rules and if they don’t work ask them how to do it following the procedures! Cos if not followed correctly you are liable and RYR will drop “ well you were operating outside OM A and in breach of SOP No.... and therefore you are personally liable. Refer to RYR documents and keep hard copies. They need to clean up their act and start thinking rather than blaming everyone except themselves for their downfall. And if verbale communications are getting out of hand, I would suggest: “by the way I inform you this conversation is being recorded for quality and training” never know when it will come in handy! Check six Tim! :+1::muscle:

[2019-02-25 14:06:37] <coolhand787> I agree Damiano. I had a similar situation, verbal conversation, very polite I must add, not so long ago where BC asked me to deviate from SOP to call engineering on ground rather than use OPS to pass on info about a/c snags before TOD prior to landing. I followed it up via email to BC and Cc to FSO and DUB Engineering and via RYR query system. BC called me back later to say he did not mean it like that. So confusion cleared up, with a written follow up. Caution is always advisable. (edited)

[2019-02-26 08:34:48] <robwatts99> Does having a guarantee of a number of hrs per year mean you are not a zero hour contractor, even if there isn't a monthly guaranteed payment? I know some people have a figure of 400hrs but is that across the board or is there still people without that minimum, flight deck or cabin.  Just wondering how this new employment law affects people here. 

<http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment_(Miscellaneous_Provisions)_Act_2018.aspx> 
[2019-02-26 09:00:57] <tuhhodge> Unbelievable.  
[2019-02-26 10:14:12] <robertgormley53> I think when I first signed as a contractor it was a guaranteed 30 hours per month 'but only if you were available for work'. So if u were out sick, took holiday, were doing a CU course etc, it didn't apply. Then when I changed bases I was required to sign a new contract and that 30 hours per month changed to something like 450 per year. I wonder why....  
[2019-02-26 11:46:35] <peter.j.marriott> I was offered either no guaranteed hours at full rate or 450 hrs a year but with a €10 or €15 reduced rate per hour. I went with the non guaranteed rate.  
[2019-02-26 11:49:40] <damiano.detomassi> Which is what they do now, raising the basic for Ryanair contracts and lowering the flight pay , its like guaranteed 450 hours on the currently on offer  SBH pay rate  
[2019-02-26 12:13:21] <coolhand787> They are just trying to squeeze us to rush and the only ones taking risks are the pilots! Sounds like the unachievable sales targets for the cabin crew! No perceived time pressure, don’t rush but be on time! This is a very perverted way perpetuated by our company and the 25min turn around is becoming utopia  
[2019-02-26 12:15:13] <coolhand787> I will scrupulously continue using DLY63 till all is correct. And LID -10 was so rare anyway. But apply the procedures, if it takes longer well Hell that’s what a DLY code is for!

[2019-02-26 13:14:36] <damiano.detomassi> And as precise as clockwork :

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Recently another take-off was carried out with Flaps 10 instead of Flaps 5. The Crew realized during flap retraction. Flaps were retracted on schedule without any exceedance, however the take-off was conducted with incorrect take-off performance calculation.

Whilst Ryanair SOPs provide several safety nets and opportunities to trap occasional error, only the diligent and unrushed application of procedures will prevent such events. Do NOT rush. (edited)

[2019-02-26 17:36:30] <maartenmegens> Thank you Robin!

I am now in the same position as Rob Velthove, above.
I took a stand and will now be forced to raise my children via Skype. I wonder if I will be around for birthdays, Christmas, schoolplays, etc.

I have said it before, and that was not received well. But this is the first time somebody is so clear and outspoken about the current situation!
I do understand we have a strong law that protects the employee, rather than the employer. But fact is multiple nations stood up when the first 300 were given notice.
After our base closure there was silence. Silence that strengthened Ryanair to use the same threats in the Canary Islands. And rumour has it for another 14 bases this year.
If nobody will stand for this, the momentum will be lost. Already a great opportunity was missed by multiple countries signing deals immediately, allowing Ryanair to carry this over the holidays. The next chance will be summer, earliest. And in that time more and more experienced and strongwilled pilots will leave. Only to be replaced by fresh cadets who will do as told by Dublin. Unknowing of the battles fought for a better future for them. When going out of base I still find myself confronted with most guys now knowing what Slack or Unity is, whatsoever.

I sincerely hope each and every pilot will get to read your story, Robin! This airlines has so much potential. Just make sure the momentum is not lost, which is currently happening. 
[2019-02-26 19:14:43] <kilroyrobin> My birthday is in August. By that time all this will have been decided, not by management, not by the fighters here, but by all the ostriches who will either say they ‘don’t want to get involved’, or else (as we all hope) they will take a stand with us and march as men and women of responsibility and resolve. They are the deciding factor, they are the swing vote. By August they will have decided for the rest of us what our profession will become, either they will have taken a stand with us or buried their heads alone - and all our futures along with them. So if any of us meet an Ostrich this spring it’s now or never, pull their head from the sand and make them see our power and our last chance. They need to pick a seat in our future, it’s time for each of us to decide now, are you a Pilot or passenger. Once spring is over, if the majority pick passenger then the cockpit door will lock and the yoke will be gone from us all. Then it’s time to turn on your phone, ignore safety briefs in favour of posting selfies during the crash in conditions, jam the exits with hand luggage on the way out, make false assessments of the cause of it all, and just generally act like your average passenger because one thing is for sure, we won’t be treated like Pilots any more. We will by lucky to make the jumped up taxi driver grade as we drag our wheelie bags back to the camp site or hostel after working our largely automated easy day’s work. (edited)

[2019-02-27 22:20:23] <damiano.detomassi> Ladies and Gentlemen,

Earlier in the month there were two line events where crew turned off the anti-collision light and gave the command to open doors, without ensuring all engines were shut down. In both occasions engine 2 was still running as there was no opportunity for single engine taxi. Crews were alerted by ground crew to shut down the engine. Avoid complacency in a critical phase of operations. FCOM1 NP.21.132 refers.

Most of us needed it just to land our first job, don’t forget that. Scraping the money, flying hour by hour, studying by day and by night. It is easy to become a taxi driver, it’s hard to become a Pilot. This level of commitment in a profession should be seen as a credit to a company, an asset, not a reason to go on a bean counters binge of exploitation trying to get more for less by leveraging the hell out of every inch of the market and placing the fulcrum of the crow bar so bloody close to the pilot that either they are at times nearly crushed, or else they leave in their droves. They leave like this because they know themselves to be an asset to be developed more than a vein to be mined to a point that moves on a trajectory which unavoidably narrows margins with a chronic exhaustion of the very resource that everyone needs us the pilots to hold and protect. It’s going to be another summer like the last with phones going at all hours trying to plug the self drilled holes in a ship that hasn’t floated on a rising tide for 3 years now. Stay determined folks, this is up to us, just like it always was.

[2019-03-05 02:41:29] <timkuijpers> I didnt reply before because I don't believe this reference comes anywhere close to the actual empty chairs mentioned above. But now that I just played and sang this song (strengthened by a small amount of whisky) I just realised the methaphoric power of this song. 

Don McLean used to be an underappreciated artist, just like many of Ryanair's employees are. But here's the plottwist: the people who are confronted most with 'empty chairs' are the ones up in the head office. How many aircraft were parked over winter? All empty chairs.. most important ones in the flightdeck.. 

"Never knew how much I needed you, - never thought you'd leave - until you went."

Let's hope someday a certain someone will realise this line is more than just a punchline of a song.  :muscle:

[2019-03-05 09:12:26] <kilroyrobin> Brilliant @timkuijpers. Your interpretation completes the missing piece in the empty chair metaphor that now works both ways. They used the empty chair to beat us, but now it beat them. I love the reversible symmetry in this metaphor, how did I miss it, maybe a little more whiskey is required. I love this. Our movement has been looking for a soundtrack for a long time, we've had the ballad of Joe Hill and a few others, but this must now be on the play list.

[2019-03-06 18:26:01] <swfmcmanus> This is a complete joke.

What happens someone who travels out in March and back in April?

What happens to the people who have booked for next summer already?

Clearly no one was consulted before this was brought in. The poor person dealing with staff travel queries will have a massive headache tomorrow from the network.  
[2019-03-06 18:49:29] <kilroyrobin> I’ve just had to tell 5 old age pensioners to go and buy tickets even though they will have gone up since I was asked if they could have my blue tickets for a holiday. Bazaar.

[2019-03-06 19:44:53] <bkehoe00> Absolute shite. I've always used my blue tickets for genuine purposes (i.e. never 'sold' them, and usually for family to visit me at shorter than 90 day notice) but yet never travelled with the people on the booking. 
[2019-03-06 19:59:22] <coolhand787> This is another dig at our ‘benefits’ which up to now are very few. Must I remind that RYR has no interline agreement and therefore we were happy to have the blue tickets to get some nice holidays with the family. Yet now the seats are confirmed but in peak/summer 90 days notice to book and limited availability? What is this for a BS again. This is just to limit Blue ticket travel so that you cannot have your relative/parents travel without you! This is a real joke.

[2019-03-09 10:03:05] <marjus1> It’s not easily done. But I think it’s pointless as all will agree it’s a poor Blue Ticket System. Anyway, management will rubbish it as an anonymous result. What maybe required is an email from every individual. That’s credible and incontestable. But nobody will bother because lone voices get lost in FR. There might be some hope if a coordinated response was submitted for Monday mornings email inbox. This is all symptomatic of how sour the relationship is. The unions have a mandate to represent us. But according to a recent BALPA update, the company are not engaging at Council level. I’m not sure where that will end. The blue ticket has added a grievance to a list of items that are not being addressed.

[2019-03-13 08:55:19] <pilot> I see it this way:
After EASA has put it’s head in the sand, seeing no reason to ground the Max, most EU states have taken action and closed their airspace, basically saying “up yours, EASA”. Now they have an easy excuse, EASA finally acts. What a bunch of faceless cowards we have at the EASA !! :triumph:

Your dream ascent to the mighty pinnacle may in the end feel much like a horizontal step as each step sinks before your very feet. Remember though that when you step upon the glorious capping stone you may ultimately sink along with it unless you plan to fight. The more stable pyramid is harder to climb. Good luck to our training department, it has held out against the deadly quick sand set by the bean counters to an outstanding degree, certainly better than the Pilots terms and conditions did to date. We must wish it well now. This is a job for a mature leadership who can hold firm against the quick sand, not be part of it, no place for yes men in the future of our ultimate anchor. When all else fails we have not much left except our training. Take that and the cascade effect will look after the house of cards.

“I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.”
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
 So keep dreaming Oliver and maybe you to will have your dreams come true.

[2019-03-16 12:31:19] <boswellbrown> No Tom, but in the US 1500 hours in a 172 is most unlikely to get you into a jet job. In Europe :+1:
We have a very different approach in Europe, is it better or worse statically speaking? You’d have to ask a statistician but what I will say is on a difficult day I know I’m working harder with a newly line checked cadet than a SFO! I’ve raised this point repeatedly over the years on various forums and to folks within the training environment and indeed directly with Ray Conway. In general it’s always the same response. “We have to work with the system we’ve got”. There’s no defending that it’s not the best or safest scenario, just a reality of where as a industry we’ve ended up. I’m sad to say it but I truly believe safety is not the industries no 1 priority right now, bottom line is! 
[2019-03-16 13:15:07] <tomisalon> Andrew, I have no doubts you will work harder with a low hour FO but would you work less with someone who has prior joining 1500h as FI in Cessna etc.? probably not, getting experience in regional jet means that extra work load is just transferred to that part of training and to those CPT's. FAA ATP and EASA ATPL/frozen ATPL are absolutely different training courses but can you say certain which of them is more effective and safe? I truly believe cost cutting has turn whole aviation industry upside down, training is brought to absolute minimum, fatigue seems to be standard instead of exception, 900h year is target instead of a limit, sim sessions are just to tick a box in standardised form instead of instructing and I could almost  bet it will not be long when we will start to fly these beasts as single pilot considering autopilot is operational. No offence to anyone just saying how I see it :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

[2019-03-16 13:56:53] <coolhand787> Guys you are missing the point regarding experience level comparison with the USA. In the USA prior to being able to apply for a job in an airline flying 737/A320, the pilots will have flown approx 1500-3500hrs in corporate/commuter turboprop operation being exposed differently to our young 350Hr FO’s. This is à European wide practice but very different than in USA. Therefore the experience level is completely different for a 737 FO as what we are used to in RYR. Evidently with flying hours comes experience and when a Ethiopian Max event occurs the likelihood that that FO will perceive the threat and ensuing challenge will be faster.

[2019-03-16 16:18:46] <realmav> Interesting article I can see what Scully met personally I've no problem flying with a low time FO just out of line training and giving them a hand lots of Captains did the same for me in FR but what I've noticed in DUB is this flying with low time FO is far to common nearly 3 or more of my 5 days are with restricted FO's and we all know the difference when the weather is on the limit between and experience head and the fresh one new guy jumping in your ear over 2 kts while it's gusting 40kts or the experience guy that's got all the weather we need for all our altn before having to be told. Takes me back to a RST I had and a poor FO called off standby to be a body just out of line training we had a rapid depressurisation!  memory items?  well a blank look came across his face but let's just say he'll never forget them again thanks to a pep talk by our very experience TRE. Sad thing is I've also flown with some displaced experienced FOs that have been uprooted from there home base by the FR bean counters good guys with experience that are all leaving to competitor airline and funny thing is the all say the would have stayed if the hadn't being moved! Far too much experience is walking out the door!

[2019-03-17 07:50:31] <kilroyrobin> I was just going to say the same thing Ian 
[2019-03-17 08:19:35] <kilroyrobin> The FO’s I have trained who have a lot of previous experience are almost invariably carrying more spare capacity and comprehension for the situation and its implications when things get tricky. They might be just as ropey, or even worse at turnaround setups or whatever, because they are unwriting old habits, but if the bells go off there is less startle and more response. Airplanes are just airplanes, what we are really managing as Pilots is ourselves and our responses to difficulties, the chariot that takes you there is a relatively small factor. However the better you get at managing yourself the more system complexities you are likely to be able to respond to correctly. Ultimately becoming a Captain is a management exercise, but fundamentally it is an exercise in managing yourself first and foremost as the hub of the wheel. If you get that right under pressure the wheel turns around you with a relatively gentle push. Fail and it falls off the hub awful quick. The further along that road the pilot beside you is the better in this endeavour, if an inexperienced FO gives you the blank face when you needed more he reflects a systemic fault caused by very powerful and senior people. Sometimes you may suffer an experience poverty in the airline, and it is those who caused this to fatten their Billion that should be asked to account for it, not the young FO doing their best.

[2019-03-17 08:43:20] <boston58730> I suspect D/HOT were offered further titles in exchange for salary cuts and finally had enough. 
A lot of guys from the training dept are so brainwashed into thinking we are industry leaders that I expect it has to come from somewhere. What FR does excel at is publishing a shit ton of guidance material and making sure training is standardised around SOP but what makes a training dept shine are the trainers. We have many good guys left but a lot of good guys have left or resigned training roles.

The real reason our training dept is the envy of EVERY airline manager is because it is so cheap. (edited)

[2019-03-20 11:32:24] <coolhand787> No idea but our BC was due to go to MRS, but turned down the proposal as the contract situation regarding social security and taxation was too vague for him. Apparently, and I heard this first hand, RYR was not able to give him all the assurances that his contract which was not yet available by the way, that tax &amp; social security compliance was assured. IMHO RYR will have to make French contracts and they are possibly discovering the French social security and taxation situation. After the MRS court case I would have thought RYR would be more up to speed? Time will tell! But me thinks tread carefully Cos in case of problems RYR will ‘hide’ behind it being a personal tax/social security problem. (edited)

[2019-03-20 12:12:35] <robertwhittle91> Right, thanks for the info guys. I’ve posted a query to Ryanair asking about the contract. Let’s see what they say.

[2019-03-20 12:24:50] <coolhand787> Robert you think wisely. And I would suggest you get written assurances from RYR before making any decisions. The absence of such assurances I would advise extreme caution. Plus remember in France all laws are in the local language so it is good to get legal advice from someone who knows the ways around the system. As you are a member of BALPA May I suggest asking for a SNPL contact to request a tax/social/legal advisor in France. This might be more trustworthy than when RYR gives you verbal assurances...  
[2019-03-20 12:49:51] <robertwhittle91> Great idea. Luckily I speak French so I should be able to get something out of the SNPL. I certainly won’t be saying yes/no until I’ve been given written details of the contract and terms. Thanks André

The productivity bonus of 12 K most of us in Spain accepted last year is not given but instead the company pays the legal French state pension.(don’t remember how much it is)
His basic pay is lowered with 3 or 4K per year and also the sector pay is lowered with (if I am not mistaken) 6 euro per hour. 
He was given a deadline of just a few days to sign or he will not be based there. (Deadline past already)

[2019-03-20 17:05:40] <coolhand787> Correct SNPL never had any contact with RYR contrary to what company lies about ... again  
[2019-03-20 18:50:22] <davedownes100> I was flying with a French guy who inquired and he was told , yes a Ryanair contract is available but you pay your tax in Ireland, work that one out  
[2019-03-20 19:21:39] <nilsholdrinet> Ryanair's stratigy for paying the costs for a proper legal contract seems to be to take it out of the wages of the workforce instead of paying their fair share like any other company. Scumbags.  
[2019-03-20 19:37:59] <coolhand787> Well David if true that RYR want to have ‘French’ contracts but continue paying taxes in Ireland! Then, as far as I recall the court case was about in MRS, then RYR are going the exact same way as before where they were sued for Millions €!. I would suspect that this time there is a small clause where RYR can legally slip out of being made liable for any social security or French taxes! So liability falls back on the poor flight crew member and RYR has screwed their staff again! I personally know of a case in Italy where the tax man considered the base as Homs base and disregarded the Double Taxation treaty and the poor lady ended up paying tax in Ireland and Italy! Same may occur in France! Great caution is advisable (edited)

[2019-03-20 20:44:20] <kilroyrobin> This constant disconnect with the value and principle of truth is utterly exhausting.  
[2019-03-20 21:52:40] <spac> They always crow about how badly Norwegian are doing, but can never hope to achieve the level of expansion of that company.

If you put the plug in and turned on the taps, this board of directors would bugger up running a bath.

[2019-03-21 09:23:48] <ginosabatino> Yep, quiet here as well. 60 hrs a month. Definitely a much quieter schedule than in past. 

You can look on idp and select up until june and see your hrs they have planned, I have 110 in may...

Also, it feels like some changes to rostering “logic”. I did a few swaps for lads that needed days off, and following weeks roster had the same hours removed, seems like they are trying to stick to a plan. I also keep getting rostered with guys on the same day as me of pattern, especially day 1 and 5. This is very unusal, especially in stn.

[2019-03-21 10:23:19] <padibartolomeo> To be honest , I still feel the pain from last years insane schedule . The less I fly the better right now , I don’t mind flying 30-40hrs if that means taking a bit of my life back . 
[2019-03-21 10:42:51] <boston58730> Same for me. I am doing around 60 per month and am happy for it. Winter flights suck anyway, fuel supervision in the rain, de-icing etc. Earn your pay with easy summer flights.

They get a diamond encrusted pension and fly Bush flying without the buckling commercial pressure that normally follows that sector like a moose in the back of a cub.

[2019-03-28 21:34:06] <kilroyrobin> The real driving force in Ryanair’s success is the average Pilots fundamental personal sense of responsibility and ‘answerability’ to their passengers who place their trust in them every time they buckle up. This core value of the profession has been rode like a donkey in the desert past every oasis for decade after decade and on with the whip for the profit gods because to an accountant the donkeys drinking time is better replaced by productivity.

Here at Ryanair we already pay you up to 20% more then the others so you get a pat on the head and no biscuit.

[2019-03-30 08:42:09] <boston58730> Anyone who can’t or won’t drive should communicate this in writing to their base manager as soon as possible so that report times vs transfer times remain the company’s responsibility.

[2019-03-30 20:46:12] <sam.vanherzele> My last fatigue report got follow up by head of safety dept and deputy in multiple phone calls. All because they couldn't believe my roster and combination of local procedures, tech problems, delays, delayed reporting, calls during rest...

2 weeks later I received a personal letter from the base manager threatening dismissal if I come up with a 'another baseless fatigue report on a benign roster'

Whoever puts their name to such letters risk criminal charges in the event of an accident due to fatigue as they are the ones who put their name on these bullying letters... One day those letters could end up in front of a judge...

[2019-03-30 21:55:44] <oliver> Sam, that is incredible.
When I was called to DUB for getting sick and receiving a final written warning letter (without any intermediate letters) , I told them that pilots are getting fatigued and eventually will get sick.
That threatening of dismissal will create a broader fear culture and more people will be going to fly while sick.
I also told them that pilots normally dont call fatigue in order to help the company out, in not getting their phenomenal rostering system scrutinized, and maybe in order to not get “targeted”. Instead of doing fatigue reports, pilots will call in sick...

At that, I heard from HR manager, (he was actually smiling saying that), that pilots cant get tired on a 5/4 benign roster, and that a pilot in MXP was actually making “baseless” fatigue reports.:rage::man-facepalming::skin-tone-2: (edited)

[2019-03-31 08:15:18] <spac> One of the sub-edits from that piece, is about employee retention. It's obvious from reading the piece that the author expects any potential employer to _care_ about it's employees.
One doesn't have to look very far, to realise Ryanair couldn't care a fig about its employees, nor employee-retention.

[2019-03-31 08:28:52] <hrvojesucic> For MOL to change his attitude and behavior towards pilots (and employees in general) would be to admit that he was wrong the entire time. He will never do that.  
	:dart: spac, jgrooney, coolhand787, laurent_lebrun
[2019-03-31 09:08:30] <pilot> Ho writes this “Hotspots” ??? Clearly not a line pilot !

Just an example: Crew made a “No ENG bleed” T/O due compressor wash, with APU bleed. De-icing fluid got into the APU inlet, creating thick fumes in cockpit after T/O.

Hotspot says:
“Crew should be aware of the inherent risk associated with fumes following a no bleeds take-off coupled with remote de-icing.” -&gt; Fair enough… but then:
“These risks can be mitigated by using effective TEM during the pre-flight planning stage.”

This makes my blood bloody boil !!!! :face_with_symbols_on_mouth:
What difference is it gonna make to say at briefing stage “there is a threat” if you cannot change anything about it ? How can you mitigate something if there is only 1 way to do it ?? The crew did exactly what they were supposed to do, just got unlucky.
This TEM is a good thing, but used completely wrong by Ryanair  !

[2019-03-31 12:43:53] <coolhand787> Bob I have noticed for a while now that some TEM philosophy is used as an alibi in case something goes wrong! Then RYR can say ah yes they mentioned it in TEM, so it’s fine! In my opinion this way of using TEM is exactly the opposite to its correct purpose, which is highlighting potential shortcomings or problems and above all having a potential solution/plan B ready! Otherwise you’ll end up with guys briefing parallel runways as a TEM, but forgetting to arm LOC when on intercept of parallel runway and flying through the localizer into the path of other Rwy!

[2019-03-31 20:16:04] <jgrooney> As usual , more and more operational documents requiring more and more work to keep up to the latest way of doing things , due to quick communications to “fix/cover” ones legal bside. More importantly , constantly changing demands on our MEMORY , when placed on crew , takes up more spare capacity for which is an extremely demanding environment on very short turnarounds that  works ( with pressure ) ...on a “normal” day . Less spare capacity for crew due company operational requirements to study , learn and then retain (until the next. change )...prior flight , that should be automatic in a new electronic environment built into each flight plan ...flight W/B to iPads . The blame rests with the crew always for not following company memos etc etc . By the time we call 80 kts , crew are already short on spare capacity , yet if something then happens and is mismanaged... then surprise ... it’s the crew fault for not following procedures. Where does it end in an environment where in the past , a memo was issued once a week or fortnight  , an fci once or twice a month or less etc etc ??? Where crew had time to adjust ! Then factor in “perceived “ time pressure ...... captains discretion etc . Where is the human limit for the lowest common denominator or ability based on personal circumstances, environmental or otherwise , as in a crews’ combined experience in aviation ? What happened to keeping it simple and creating spare capacity for the unforeseen ? Aviate first , but spare capacity is needed. It’s difficult to get just a few minutes for oneself , prior departure, even on turnarounds to stand back to view the bigger picture . More recently ...if one crew member knows something new from a new company publication / memo etc and the other doesn’t or hasn’t time to read up on , then what about the crew’s situational awareness or regard for what the regulators (via the company ) wants just now , or cross cockpit gradient natural safe levels???  Crew are caught up in memo after memo after memo . Where’s the limit ? (edited)

I felt like I’d lost the ability to think through the approach doing as you go from start to finish to now blindly following a procedure that had me end up at the runway, the whole big picture stuff started to fade out, the gear went down at the green ring and we set this at this point when he said something and the aircraft did this to get us here, even still now everything is just so press this now do that then, I think the big picture is nowhere to be seen!! I did an approach one time when ATC asked for min approach at about 10 miles, then we passed 4 miles and the fo called gear down flap 15!! It’s not his fault, that’s just how this show is run! Anti ice off at 6 miles out on approach, why’s he’s switched the start switches off?? I guess maybe it works, but goin back to the point, the amount of sop’s in this place compared to anywhere else was a fucking culture shock, and it’s only got worse and worse, and with the fci novel just acting as a bloody contradiction to the rest of the manuals, amendments, fci’s, memos, emails, compulsories, non compulsories, how the fuck are we supposed to keep up!!

[2019-03-31 21:51:42] <coolhand787> Sam you are right 100%! I am here 12yrs and where I was before we were keeping it simple! Here just when they write a new memo, I think they must pay someone to make it as complicated and incomprehensible! Me thinks it’s so there is always a way to wrangle it so that it’s the pilots/cabin crews fault not the company. And yes back side covering for the management. They put out contradicting memos FCIs etc. And this 4 memos/FCI’s a day. It’s like the crew retention issue, just patch it up with a piece of FCI MEMO tape and we’ll be fine! Same goes for fatigue reports and management’s view! There is a real need to muck out the shed here IMO! The way I see it only communicating with ECA/EASA will move something cos IAA are not moving an inch unless RYR asks for it! It’s similar to Boeing writing the risk assessment for the Max instead of the FAA. Here it’s RYR writing the books/procedures/APPs and IAA just signs it! The result will likely be the same as for the poor victims of Ethiopian/Lion Air!

[2019-04-01 13:08:08] <coolhand787> Pilots doing MAINTROL work now with latest Bird Strike Inspection procedure. Check out RA210 Rev 7 used on 25 March. Now it is for the pilot to take a copy of the tech log and email to MAINTROL and then call MAINTROL to ask if email received. So here is yet another task, after checking which catering config we have, now we are sending emails for MAINTROL and ask if received. First question are we doing Engineerings work?  Second Question is, can we now proceed with flight or get confirmation paperwork is correct from MAINTROL prior to dispatch? Query has been raised  (edited)

[2019-04-03 11:06:45] <timkuijpers> I used to have the luxery never to divert. But may last year a storm front, BA medium combined with an 1863m runway made me and the FO cave and just fly to Hahn :sweat_smile:

Now I've received an email wether I will be available to attend as a witness in a courtcase against Ryanair. I'm just looking for some advice on the options I have. (Do I even have a choise?) 

The hearing is at Day 2 of lates.. I'm not sure how that will effect my productivity :see_no_evil:
Also I've always pictured myself in a courtcase against Ryanair, not helping them! :joy:

But seriously I don't see what I have to add to my already complete CSR that was filed at the end of the day.. 
[2019-04-03 11:17:55] <coolhand787> Hello Tim that is interring news indeed. This is most probably due to a compensation claim against RYR due to the diversion. Regarding the technicalities of how this goes and your obligations as commander, I would suggest contacting the German CC and VC for advice. Also, I recall a UK pilot having to attend a court hearing in a similar issue. Maybe post your request on Slack ma-BALPA channel too! In any case I would consult your Base Captain and ask for written advice from RYR. This is just to see how much support you will get from your employer vs your CC and VC. Happy Landings Tim! PS: And get a hard copy of your CSR plus print out RYR follow up  (edited)
[2019-04-03 11:24:40] <damiano.detomassi> Indeed . This was discussed later last year as I found out 2200 court cases in the pipeline were about to start and some of them require Cpt to bare witness .  we don’t have yet reached the stage of this discussion as a pilot group as seem to think its a minor issue and not so often . But bare in mind testify as an actor in a court case it’s not as risk free as it seems . Careful preparation from lawyers and support from the employer is required . Further to this I suggest to direct the legal department at VC because it’s their field .  
[2019-04-03 11:44:09] <martin.loxbo> I had a similar thing a few months ago, although it concerned a delay and no diversion. In the end I just had to sign a statement confirming the arrival time of the flight, and I never had to attend court. Already had my duty changed to COURTDUT so effectively I got an extra day off out of it. :smile: 
[2019-04-03 12:23:21] <ginosabatino> This happened before to a captain, he diverted and got a court summons sometime later. The judge allowed him to do a video appearance, and it was immediately thrown out of court. Judge said jog on, capt decision is final.  
[2019-04-03 13:43:42] <boswellbrown> I too was asked for a statement but this time by Ryanair lawyers. However turned out it would be to Ryanair’s detriment as the pax was correct... assume it went in the bin? In this case best to take VC’s advice. No doubt you have to appear if the court asks you to but not sure about a pax asking you to?

[2019-04-05 06:28:30] <arnaud2cagny> This is awesome! 
[2019-04-05 06:55:19] <fergus.cassidy> As Oliver said above, plus delay code 41, that codes strikes the fear of God into any engineer as it's always followed up on. They hate delays. 
But why is this new procedure required. Another example of inadequate numbers of people doing the jobs they shoukd be doing. Some bird strike wasn't picked up on and it was probably found during an IAA audit.
Answer. Get the pilots to do it as well. It won't make a difference if the engineers are under perceived time pressure too. They'll rush the filling of the bird strike into AIMS and it will still get missed for review. The amount of times I've had to insist on a record been kept and a techlog entry is frustrating. You repeatedly hear "we'll do it later tonight" with my answer been "so SNN is going to get manned engineering cover as we've no one full time." 
[2019-04-05 07:14:11] <tomflood737> Excellent in the true sense of the word.  
[2019-04-05 07:16:27] <swfmcmanus> I thought they were using Skype in HQ... Wouldn't a crew code based Skype address solve a lot of issues as long as you have connectivity? 
[2019-04-05 07:22:40] <fergus.cassidy> Not over 3G it won't. Maybe voice only. It'll cost them money to increase the data usage that's why we need permission to get access to the folder with all the approach plates and RTOW charts, etc. 
[2019-04-05 07:26:49] <coolhand787> Sure Serks I pray every day! And great suggestions by Oliver for the Phone call via handling agent. In TGD I had to walk 10 min to tower as this was only call capability! And in Morokko, Israël, Lithuania it will be very expensive! Fergus, DLY 41 it will be mandatory and it will shake the tree :deciduous_tree: at engineering who are already thinly manned at best times. I wonder how it will go when you have to wait 3-4 min till they pick up cos 3 different CPTs are calling for Birdstrike confirmation receipt! Yep let’s stick to their ever increasing line of additional tasks and they ll are at HQ how great their new ideas are. It reminds me so much of OPT procedure and DLY 63! This sends shock waves up to Aidan MURRAY who oversees these delays. Oh shit new load sheet is saving 20€ per load sheet but hell our punctuality is down in 70s... :thinking_face::flushed: How can we pressure, sorry no perceived time pressure, our pilots to cover up this idiosyncrasie?

[2019-04-06 07:57:38] <arnaud2cagny> FOD in new aircrafts, in enclosed compartments, enjoy the new aircrafts guys, for sure we would stop getting our aicrafts if that was the case. (oops didn't put that correctly FODebriS... FOD-S) (edited)
[2019-04-06 08:24:13] <boston58730> Absolute folly over there at Boeing. Cost cutting their way to ignore the warnings of experienced staff and hobbling the most profitable aviation manufacturing company that ever existed.

Let us all unite in pointing the finger at their greed and the total failure of the FAA. Here at Ryanair we put excellence above all else and our quality departments are the envy of the world.* If all else fails the ever vigilant IAA are on top form and will cover their asses in true bureaucratic style.

[2019-04-07 20:00:33] <brendanjacobs> Is it per SBH for all of them Dave, do you know? I thought some are paid actual block, I’ve also heard some say it’s flight time, airborne to landing. There seems to be some who have no idea what it should be. 
[2019-04-07 20:19:57] <davemcilhatton> As far as im aware its SBH for them all. Definitely agency anyway. Ive copies of her current contract and the offer of the newer one if you need them.

[2019-04-08 06:48:44] <jessica.emurphy2009> Thanks guys , I can help a family member make a better informed decision on where to go if they get offered a choice of base. Looking like Germany getting better pay. 
[2019-04-08 07:19:04] <swfmcmanus> Out of interest, is the gross divided by duty time more than minimum wage? 
[2019-04-08 07:46:28] <davemcilhatton> Jessica another thing to keep in mind is growth I know some bases its nearly impossible to get No1 other bases can be a year. Also if the base isnt a popular base it will be hard to get out of.  Worth looking into each base when the offer is given they differ greatly as the BS have more "influence" for example they decide if you can put a swap through I remember my wife being denied them based on sales! 
[2019-04-08 07:59:38] <davemcilhatton> Shane its just about minimum wage I think it works out about 15-17k a year roughly 10-12 euro per duty hour then they get ground duties, bank holiday pay, commissions, medical &amp; uniform and airport standby. Its the newer contracts id be unsure of my wife recently got part time and they offered her the new contract with a basic of 700ish and a flight pay of 6 or 7 euro they told her this would be halved for part time.

[2019-04-08 08:54:43] <brendanjacobs> Why would flight pay be halved, not doing half a flight! It’s a joke. It must boil your blood Dave, seeing how they treat cabin crew. 
[2019-04-08 12:19:35] <swfmcmanus> Does anyone have a number for HR? Former colleague looking for a reference and struggling to get a reply via email... Thanks

[2019-04-08 23:50:07] <davemcilhatton> We arnt 100% sure if thats the case but thats how it was worded in the letter! To be fair they have been very helpful to my wife, we are just surprised they keep renewing her contract with four consecutive pregnancies! Lol

[2019-04-09 09:38:18] <mauricetreanor> Seems straight forward enough....if you have bars, go. If there's no bars/water in bars then get some before you go? 
[2019-04-09 09:41:15] <ronan.walsh22> The word ‘normally’ was interpreted by a duty pilot to mean I can go with a flight less than 2 hours one night in Murcia. :man-shrugging: 
[2019-04-09 09:41:32] <tomflood737> So the cabin crew can serve food without the facility to wash their hands.  
	:100: johnfaessel
[2019-04-09 09:44:03] <ronan.walsh22> Also bars loaded can be interpreted also....a few bottles of water left over from the previous flight seems to meet that description for some. (edited)
[2019-04-09 09:44:34] <mauricetreanor> I'd happily use and tell cabin crew to use the bottled water for that. Explain it in capts remarks.

[2019-04-09 10:32:14] <robwatts99> First bullet point. Safety of operation ahead of commercial considerations. Next list of points basically states commercial considerations come first. As mentioned above what to do in case of fire? What to do in case of hygiene? What to do in case of disruptive pax due no food or water on board? If no bottled water do we serve water from tank?  
[2019-04-09 10:36:45] <masterharkin> My understanding is that to dispatch with zero potable water and zero bar water would actually be illegal. Please see extract from the Health &amp; Safety Authority.

[2019-04-10 14:17:09] <tyronebloem> So I can’t take my family in the flightdeck, if that is the case 
[2019-04-10 14:18:27] <pnelson377> Don’t quote me but it’s your family (brothers , sister , parents) white tickets for them should work with ‘standby’ permission from uncle rays office  
[2019-04-10 14:20:12] <tyronebloem> Ok, I can try that. Because officially someone can’t go in the flight deck on a white ticket normally.  
[2019-04-10 14:25:41] <julien.benazzi> Because Blue tickets are now confirmed I understood this was now consideres as revenue pax and therefore no flight deck allowed ... only white ... 
[2019-04-10 14:41:48] <damiano.detomassi> White ticket totally fine for flight deck if employed pilot is onboard . Blue was required for non family in flight deck . (edited)

[2019-04-13 09:40:52] <kilroyrobin> BLUE TICKETS? New staff travel only allowed booking as adults. Now when I go to check in it needs an adult date of birth for the kids, meaning they will be seated randomly. Anybody got a solution? So far the best I have is try to sort it out at the boarding gate....  
[2019-04-13 10:04:39] <brendanjacobs> This is the problem with all their plans in HQ. They only consider the money saving aspect of a plan but not the practical implementation of it.

[2019-04-13 12:16:55] <spac> @robwatts99 
It doesn't matter what their terms are. They live in their own homes with their families. Many of *us* are forced to live away; the requirement for us to have to waste valuable time off, going to where our families live, before having holidays together, and then wasting more time returning to a foreign base is just another example of the company's 'cruel and inhumane treatment' of its employees.

[2019-04-13 13:12:32] <robwatts99> I'm well aware of the effects the new system has on everyone and the inconvenience it causes so I don't need to be told. But if you look at the point I actually made I'm talking about the differences to how staff are treated. We get a reply and memos telling us how great the system is and how lucky we are they changed it to benefit us. But do we really think they apply the same standards to themselves. My guess would be that they have an entirely different system with next to no limitations but then they sit on their high horse telling the peasants how lucky we are they are throwing some crumbs our way.

I have received a number of emails regarding the requirement to complete the e-learning course on the Boeing 737 Max. I am of the understanding that the Federal Aviation Authority have removed the certification for that particular aircraft and as such it is now considered to be a “prototype aircraft”. Is it approved by the regulator to do the course under these circumstances or should I delay the course until it becomes a certified commercial aircraft again?

[2019-04-15 09:37:31] <spac> Can you send a link to the 'prototype aircraft' document, please?

[2019-04-15 14:13:30] <coolhand787> And it’s only April... Tic Toc  
[2019-04-15 16:17:37] <richardbwhite> Anybody know where to find the relatives forms on in order to add family members on to white ticket list?   
[2019-04-15 16:20:44] <rogierbrink> Intranet in a crewroom? 
[2019-04-15 16:21:01] <johnmurray737> No good to you Richard but would also be interested in knowing.  
[2019-04-15 17:16:36] <tomflood737> I think the base Captain needs to sign the form and then this needs to be emailed to someone in HQ.  
[2019-04-15 17:20:01] <sam.vanherzele> Form is indeed on intranet (from crewroom: log into crewdock and 'intranet' on top). 
Form needs to be singed by 'manager' before being returned to HQ 
[2019-04-15 17:31:52] <kilroyrobin> How many can you add to that list? 
[2019-04-15 18:07:34] <arnaud2cagny> Only parents of the pilot wife and children, I have tried to stick my in laws but it didn't work 
[2019-04-15 18:18:28] <richardbwhite> I sent a query to staff travel and they sent back the required form. It’s to be filled out, signed by base captain/manager and faxed, yes faxed, back to interline. There’s no limit but if married only your spouse, parents, children under 21 and if single your parents, siblings under 21. Date of marriage is also required on the form.  
[2019-04-15 19:19:17] <padibartolomeo> Would be nice if we could push for at least in laws to be added .

But then every base agreement I’ve seen says the rank of Senior FO ceases to exist for new promotions since 2008. :joy: (edited)

---- 2019-04-16 ----
[2019-04-16 01:08:24] <ginosabatino> So line training takes about 80ish sectors, probably about 130hrs. So another 370hrs on the line and senior fo?

[2019-04-16 04:01:30] <coolhand787> And I really feel for our colleagues in Spain/Portugal/Italy where in summer we get 30+ Deg C up to 45 in SVQ... great with the tie! RYR think the uniform will be that all is fine... window dressing again :face_vomiting::face_vomiting::face_vomiting:

[2019-04-16 06:37:41] <boston58730> On the plus side we don’t need to worry about the MAX Suicide anymore. PB reckons “Ryanair will not fly the aircraft until it has passed all EASA certification and our own internal risk analysis.”

I for one feel safer already. Those guys at Boeing must be shaking in their boots. They can get it past FAA, EASA and CAAC certification for sure but a Ryanair risk analysis?

PB forever! (edited)

[2019-04-16 06:48:39] <boston58730> It’s quite normal to fly with someone you don’t know at least 2/5 per block at STN. Used to only ask about experience if they had 2 stripes. When the definition changed a few years back now I just ask how long guys have been in FR/STN and gauge experience from the getting to know you stage.

Three of the worst guys I flew with were full grown 3 ringers (long gone :pray: ) and some of the best were around 500 hours so I learned not to prejudge anyone anyway. 
[2019-04-16 08:06:23] <pilot> The eloquence if that memo represents the level of our management. Sounds like he wrote it on the loo. 
The random “hits” he rambles about make absolutely no sense.  
[2019-04-16 09:36:22] <ginosabatino> Ryr risk analysis is 

“Do we have enough aircraft to make another billion? No? Put it into service asap.”

[2019-04-16 12:22:45] <brendanjacobs> I see there’s an update on the right of crewdock to correct the rank marking typo. Except, it doesn’t look like anything has been corrected. Can’t get anything right. I think the problem is that the people in HQ don’t actually understand what it is we do and why we have certain procedures etc. It’s like the acronym CSS, once was cabin safety supervisor, then cabin service supervisor and now the ads they put out on fleet tweet refer to them as cabin sales supervisors. That’s not why they’re there. Their primary function is to ensure the safety of everyone on board.

[2019-04-17 08:55:40] <jorgelucca> For us this is a very very far dream. How nice it could be! 
[2019-04-17 09:15:25] <kilroyrobin> You mean like a system that keeps replacing it’s experienced Captains with a newer captain who according to the companies own statistics has a 20% chance of an incident in their first 12 months, because the company fails to provide terms and conditions and a culture of mutual respect that will retain staff, but then when said new captain returns to stand unnecessarily (or worse) they get shamed on crew dock for delaying hundreds of passengers (de identified of course) even though everyone in the base knows exactly who it was by default, but the lesson learned is always had they done what we said this would all be fine. The thing is though, the hundreds and thousands of instructions we are given take time to consolidate. The best metaphor for this (pinched straight from reality) is when a new joiner is presented with 2500 compulsory reads on crew dock before they can report for duty. You sign it and then it’s your fault if you forget, not the system. Never the system.

That’s what you could call it but it actually the beginning of new chapter in my career. After 11 years in Ryanair it’s time for me to leave and continue my career back home at Corendon Dutch Airlines. The last 6 months have not been easy for me due to all the problem that where created by the downsize of NRN. Today I did my last flight for Ryanair and as I have stated already to several people. “I’ll miss the people, not the company.” So to everyone that I have had met and had the pleasure of working and flying with thanks for all the memory’s. I wish you all the best for the future and may we meet again at a airport in the world or even just talk on the radio on 123.450. 

My totals for the 11 years in Ryanair. 

Flight hours 8968
Sim hours 296
Total hours 9264
That’s 842 hours per year. Let’s just say I have been kept busy. 

I would also like to thank all the people here on slack. Keep up with fighting the good fight. Even though I’m leaving I’m beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel here in Ryanair. It will be a few more months hopefully before it’s all done and you can be proud of what you have accomplished.

I have had the pleasure of staying in your new airlines hotel “The Corendon” on a number of occasions of late. You should pop in there some time as the whole theme is based around a Corendon aircraft.

[2019-04-17 22:12:28] <padawa> I had a call from a bc the other week checking what the delay was for, I must have forgot to put it on, he didn’t really care to be fair he was just following it up but it was of course for the new OPT. He did say tho that “they” are mad for these first wave delays now. I just told him “they’d” better get used to it or increase the report time! Also told him that sometimes I find myself pushing back wondering how the f*** I got there!! It’s a bit like gettin in the car and finding yourself at home with no recollection of the bit in the middle! Literally don’t come up for air sometimes!

[2019-04-18 06:37:59] <thomas> The endless EFB updates are hard to keep track of as well. A lot of new procedures have been added over the course of only a few weeks and I find myself constantly forgetting one or the other. Now I know I haven't been in the company that long but the turnarounds now remind me of those during my line training, always feeling rushed and pushed for time. You almost start looking forward to the dispatcher being late or for the PRMs to be slow so you can have a bit of a breather.

[2019-04-18 06:47:37] <tomflood737> With all the extra workload - there is not one second spare during the turnaround.

If giving the choice between a phone call for a delay or a phone call to my next of kin, it’s pretty obvious which I’d choose. 

Our SOPs are the bedrock to safe flight. The “S” is for “Standard” not “Shortcut”.

[2019-04-18 07:29:52] <kilroyrobin> Every time they investigate an accident I get peace in knowing that it’s lessons will be learned and applied, most of them appear on a checklist in fact, Helios is one that comes to mind. That is what aviation is about. The checklist should therefore be read at a respectful pace. Respectful of those who paid the price. Rushing a checklist, reading from memory and rime responses is like running across peoples graves, maybe even your own. The people that drive you to rush because a share price might be hit by adding minutes to a turnaround are disrespecting the realities of our challenge and our responsibilities. It is interesting also to note that F/Os can in fact feel under greater pressure. The iPad requires so much put in to it now that the FO is practically completing a full Audit on each turnaround. I find after a few days in the right it’s a relief to get back in the left and ditch that extra burden. We should be mindful of that in the left. In the last week alone I have caught a pack off, no probe heat and no flap selected - this is by reading at a quarter of my old pace when I flew the regular line, admittedly those errors were in training, but the only difference between competence and incompetence in many cases is either of two things; fatigue or rushing. We are not short of either. (edited)

I would appreciate inputs prior to my response. My opinion is that RYR is definitely creating a perceived time pressure and asking is for document falsification for either writing flights on time or using a different DLY code to cover up the ELS issues. This is becoming a flight safety issue as RYR management is pushing us to rush procedures with this kind of statement and this is unacceptable! Your comments/ideas are welcome!

[2019-04-19 10:51:52] <grahamkendall13> Wow... 
[2019-04-19 10:53:22] <damiano.detomassi> Our BC totally said it’s still ok, but then of course it was few days ago. I had a total imbalance happening and we had to move pax phisically due to very light load and wrong ground handling processes , I put it on extended calculations . Rushing trough opt is a no go for me as I saw : wrong N1 , wrong ZFW, wrong MAC% being inserted and only 4 eyes could pick up that . the slot is not a problem , Miss it I can, a burning hole at the end of the runway I cannot accept . Having said that I also queried the company as to why we have to have ground copy the computer at the gates data into a piece of paper , we need to copy the piece of paper into an iPad , copy those numbers into a fmc . How many errors are those passages causing in a day ? It’s a ridiculous cheap setup . 
[2019-04-19 11:11:00] <coolhand787> Damiano I totally agree with you the flight safety implications are enormous and so are the associated risks. Rushing is a no go for me too! I make a time check every time I start ELS process and done correctly it requires 4-5min if all data is correct and no errors made! Exactly Wrong ZFW, wrong N1 (too low) could cause, in case of EF after V1 that you cannot guarantee the minimum screen height and collision risk with obstacles at the end of Rwy and a big smoking hole! I intend to respond accordingly to BC. From a flight safety point of view, there needs to be a network wide awareness of ELS risks in case of errors or rushing just to avoid DLY 63. I know BC and the company are pushing to eliminate ELS delays, but they have to realize that 25min is not extensible nor is safety! Period

[2019-04-19 11:13:29] <coolhand787> This is CP note 04 Dec 2018 that no perceived time pressure exists in RYR, yet they try to make us rush procedures! It’s quite a perverted way!  (edited)
[2019-04-19 11:21:05] <maassen.maik> Lately a dispatcher, I think in SOF, said Ryanair instructed them to no more use code 80 engine start on a self-manoeuvring stand.
Had never heard of that before and I don't see the point in that.
For things obviously causing delays, how can you forbid that?? To cover up a 25 min turnaround doesn't work with certain procedures?
Absolute bollocks 
[2019-04-19 11:23:22] <coolhand787> Maik I agree it seems Ryanair Management are trying to hide the inadequacy of their business model and before ELS 25 min was possible if all went without a hitch. Now with ELS RYR has passed another task to squeeze inside the 25 min TA! This obsession with hiding the truth just for profit is going to kill someone eventually  
	:point_up: robertwasilewski, bmcloughlin970
[2019-04-19 11:50:56] <spac> If it's code 63, then 63 is what to put. Ask the BC in an email, so there's a trail, what he suggests using to hide the company's pennypinching. 
[2019-04-19 11:51:46] <arpadheger1977> Use 62 fuel supervising cause this is most of the time a combination of different issues, as simple as that. Agree no rush.... no,no! (edited)
[2019-04-19 12:13:51] <paul> It's not up to anyone but you to decide what is "acceptable" as a delay code - only you can decide what caused the delay, and record that as accurately as possible. Now it's also not unreasonable to be asked for more detail - if it were me, and my judgement was that 63 was the correct delay code, I'd defend that decision and stand by it, and explain why it caused the delay. 
[2019-04-19 12:14:45] <coolhand787> Sure Arpad this avoids having to explain the inherent problems of ELS and hence hiding the truth to RYR management. I think ELS of rushed is a threat to flight safety. Therefore I use 62 and 63 DLY code to clearly differentiate. The number of potential errors when doing the data entry into OPT then transferring data into FMC and making sure proper selection of N1 and verifying stab trim make ELS a very cumbersome procedure and this costs time! Let’s not wait for a smoking hole to say to RYR well the ELS takes time and there are great many bear traps causing a flight safety issue  
[2019-04-19 12:16:12] <coolhand787> Member thanks for your input I agree 100% and that’s what I do. Would you be so kind and update/insert your details in Slack. Thanks 
[2019-04-19 12:20:32] <arpadheger1977> Yes and no. The delay on ELS is caused by all the other shit we have to do on the ground, and THAT is operational issue... so that is why it is also 62 in my opinion (edited)
[2019-04-19 12:31:33] <coolhand787> Ok Arpad I get your point. Yet the inherent design of ELS app has a potential of input errors due to many input/selections having to be made. 1.) LID transcription into OPT 2.) ZFW into FMC 3.) Selection of correct N1/THR 22-24-26k Rating in FMC 4.) CG input into FMC and verification of correct STAB trim. Think one minute about flight safety implications. Example: 22k selected instead of 26k and this is required due higher MTOW, if after V1 engine failure, for sure the required screen height will never be achieved!  
[2019-04-19 12:34:43] <coolhand787> Back in Feb 2019, I spoke to BC TFS a very competent and open minded man, who’s name escapes me now, and he admitted RYR réalises the clumsiness of OPT procedure and wants to review it! We are now April and nothing has come? Why because RYR wants to squeeze pilots to avoid having to admit their LID/OPS/ELS procédure is not adequate to say the least 
[2019-04-19 12:37:44] <coolhand787> And after reducing gate closure to STD -10 and LID STD -8 DLYs are still there! Just to save 30€/load sheet. The real solution would have been a download of LID data from gate into OPT! Hence cutting out many potential errors. But that would require a competent IT department cos these new apps are not adequate

[2019-04-19 12:41:26] <damiano.detomassi> Another heads up. When you transfer RTE2 into active (to save time in turn around you diligently prepared it during cruise ) the whole thing is fine apart from runway (the runway symbol is missing on fmc but magenta is there ) if when the other pilot  comes in from walk around you quickly go on about OPT and depart , you realize you have that missing , and now you insert it , v speeds are deleted , that is very useful info but ALSO THE THRUST SETTING IS so be careful to start back from n1 (and use the bug card opt output to re populate the fmc . Yet another fXxX up possible . (Noticed the pressure from new handling agents to depart ? They are desperate ) (edited)

[2019-04-19 13:08:07] <coolhand787> And regarding handling agent they just want to get rid of flight without delay so no explications to RYR management  
[2019-04-19 13:09:44] <coolhand787> But why are RYR management so adamant to avoid/minimize delays? Possibly cos not enough crews so every minute saved counts (well on paper) and to show the cost saving of in house Load Sheet is again a great saving! Makes lord MOL happy

All I meant was that, I (personally) do not preceive any pressure since I am (in this case) resistent against it. If I have a delay, then it is because of issues which I cannot influence. In such a case it is workload adding up, which (physically) is impossible to solve in 25mins. So be it.... not my problem, but it is an Ops issue. I do everything as quickly as possible but never unsafe. If I miss a slot, I taxi back to refuel or whatever...  things which are beyond my influence. How RYR solves various issues, and WHY they do it? I don‘t know, but that also cannot stress me (edited)

[2019-04-19 15:14:56] <damiano.detomassi> I agree with Arpad for experience pilots but there are cases of a bad roster with 3000/200 pilots which will perceive the pressure so it’s our “job” to raise awareness at least in my view . In txl we have a very efficiency BC that goes out of his way to assure we give all the details to him or gops manager about any delay. We get 3 email from BC a week about it .....if that isn’t putting pressure don’t know what else . (edited)
[2019-04-19 15:18:44] <kilroyrobin> “Perceived time pressure”, and then this e-mail. It is an absolute contradiction in a machine that denies any such thing. It’s as bonkers as living in an octopuses garden under the sea. It really is difficult to engage with this level of totally irrational and two faced behaviour in a rational way. You get consumed by its insanity if you try to fight it alone. If you were to try to genuinely converse and engage logically with this senseless and detail obsessed monster it would be a disease on your own sanity - but you can’t loose that in this game. Go some way along the road by all means, but at the end of the day the only wisdom and rationale you will hear in the conversation will be your own. Don’t wear yourself down with it, Unity doesn’t do martyrs. This is why Unity has been such a gift to us here. It gives us areas where common sense can win and unity can jam up the madness and stop the machine occasionally while we bring change, instead of launching ourselves head long as individuals into the share price fuelled logic macerator.

[2019-04-19 19:05:13] <brendanjacobs> It seems there’s no distinction between doc certified or self certified. It’s the number of absences, regardless of reason. 4 letter, 6 call, 8 meeting. Apparently.

[2019-04-19 19:10:13] <arnaud2cagny> Has anyone ever followed up(file) something with the country they were going to fly to, not the IAA after receiving steps 4,6,8? 
[2019-04-19 19:28:19] <maassen.maik> Not sure it's always the 4, 6, 8. Personally I was sick on four occasions in 2018, a total of 8 days, then another day in February 2019, which was the fifth occasion in 12 months and I never heard anything except the standard mail "we may call you to ask about your well-being" bla bla which never happened.
A colleague was not sick for more than a year, then two seperate days within a month and got a call from Declan Ryan, another one got a meeting for being sick the first or second time ever just because it was in the Christmas period. 
[2019-04-19 19:35:51] <iglehane> Same response for me.

[2019-04-20 01:00:32] <tuhhodge> I agree with many of the above sentiments, however I would point out that if one were to now introduce departures based on loadsheets drafted by underqualified and under-motivated dispatchers and performance calculated by extensive tables and interpolation, one might expect strong resistance, yet here we are. Also, for years an app has been available to calculate brake cooling but we can't use it, instead we use poorly designed tables. AGB... 

Seriously, though, I see the OPT as a good thing. After all, it's what we all wanted but could only have by telephoning Dublin if we had a non-standard runway. Assuming the software is accurate (and one presumes it is at least as accurate as that which comes out of the 16k ZX Spectrum FMC) then the problem is with 'perceived time pressure'. 

Personally, I can complete the LID to blocks off in 8 minutes. But the LID us always late, for whatever reason. Asked about this, the official line as spoken to LTCs is that we should put 31 or 62 if RFS was done, end of story. Fine with me, as it's not the OPT calculation that takes time. If the LID is wrong or pax must be moved, that's also 31, IMHO. 

By the way, word is that 93 is also on the way out. We'll be asked to look back at the previous flight and put the reason the flight arrived late... Good luck with that one... (edited)

[2019-04-20 07:19:23] <coolhand787> Right guys all copied and yes LID is very often late why cos Gate now closes at STD-15 and we should get LID STD-8! Always cutting corners! The big picture probably why to squeeze us so much is that pilots and cabin crew staffing still very tight! Plus RYR plays with shortening block times enough to keep the IATA on time performance up to 15min late where they can claim on time yet always pay pilots less!  
[2019-04-20 07:36:00] <arpadheger1977> Long, long time ago when I did my upgrade a TRE (left RYR in the meantime) told me, he would NEVER check the scheduled off block time in the turnaround before he is asking for push and start for the next sector. That would avoid rushing on the ground, since he does not know what the sched. off block was anyway.... just another way to handle it:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (edited)

[2019-04-20 09:55:13] <damiano.detomassi> Funny you mention this Arpad . I never tell the cabin we have a slot , I tell the FO to never tell, I tell the ground to never tell and when the FO tells me we have a slot I totally ignore the number . We do the things at the same speed and then we see what happens . The other day in CFU , we had apparently a tight  slot , pax out of balance and 280 hours FO , we departed 2 min before expiry but I felt very relaxed as I had NO IDEA . I suggest ;-) 
[2019-04-20 11:15:03] <tuhhodge> Great suggestion Damiano! 
[2019-04-20 11:33:03] <oliver> In general they dont believe us and always look for a trend or an excuse to justify their narrative: 

its more often during the beginning of duty... you want to make longer days off

Or towards the end..... you want to anticipate your days off....

Or it is in the middle of the weeek.... you probably dont rest enough and want to sleep over.....

Or it is during a holiday....

Or it is close to your sim session....

Or I see that......

They always find some excuse, doctor certificate doesnt really matter to them, they dont trust them aswell.

So you can be sick for three month and it is not a problem, but if you get sick just a few days, than they simply dont believe you.

Same problem is with the disciplinary meetings. They dont believe in being fatigued or calling fatigued.
Some used to call in sick when they were fatigued, and it was ok somehow, but now not anymore with DR. So you cant be fatigued and you cant be sick either.

What you can be is a recipient of a disciplinary final warning with no intermediate steps or warnings, giving the company the power to use any excuse (noshow, car incident, traffic delay etc) in bypassing their own (irish) rules, and therefore to simply let you go in clear conscience despite not being able to legally fire someone for sickness unless they are sick more than 6 month in a two year period.

[2019-04-20 12:56:24] <coolhand787> Oliver I find you put it perfectly about the sickness procedure. It is sickening, sorry for the comparative, but RYR can not accept people getting sick! This is not possible with their business model. We are to be like robots never sick never fatigued never speak out against this aberration company and it’s  so sometimes dubious actions! Well no! I speak out and so do you Oliver and we get targeted with Final Written Warnings when RYR as you correctly put it abused the Irish disciplinary system! Just like interrupting rest, not allowing to exert your commanders discretion ! I let you guess why! RYR are very harsh against people who speak out because others could follow suit and then a movement is created! Our best defense UNITY and support from Pilot Union/ECA/EASA. The IAA will not stop RYR as they are paying them a huge amount of income! So guys bottom line responsibility lies with you to ask am I fit to fly or not! If not and you go fly, Make a mistake, the persecution and perversion of RYR will fall upon you! The little rat of Declan Ryan will say: “oh why do you come to fly when unfit to do so, you should not do that! You operated outside OM A so now you and your whole family are responsible... bla bla bla” it’s the perverted but true reality we work in every day! So fight for our rights! I will continue UNITED with our fellow pilots cos as Robin so right put it, as an individual RYR will take you out! Be smart about your actions and CYA = cover you back side. i.e. keep pictures, videos, hard/electronic copies on your own pc of everything... just in case it comes in handy! Believe me it is worth it! And then never go into the fight without getting advice/support and in some cases accompanied to the meetings by a fellow pilot colleague. I am so grateful this great privilege and honor was granted to me! You step into the meeting with someone covering your six! Happy Landings and Happy Easter to you all! (edited)

[2019-04-24 10:31:34] <derekirl> So after 2 months and 3 e mails with no reply for a new page for the License , I decided to phone earlier.
Press option 2 they say for Flight crew Licensing .
Then they tell you this option is not available .
So I spoke to a Lady at Reception who informed me that they are so busy it’s unlikely you will get through so it’s best call in to the office if possible :man-shrugging::skin-tone-2:
It’s ok for me as I’m in DUB but for anyone else, you may need to allow some time . 
[2019-04-24 14:51:51] <boston58730> Haven’t dealt with them in years but I bet if you phoned in as a new customer with your credit card handy, they would deal with you within 5 mins. Same old story everywhere now. 
[2019-04-24 15:12:35] <hrvojesucic> Well, they certainly need to charge me 400-500 EUR for unlocking my ATPL. I will go downtown personally, it’s just that I don’t want to get to Dublin a day earlier (commuter) only to be informed that I’m missing this or that piece of paper.  
[2019-04-24 15:20:02] <hrvojesucic> The guys at EMT were very helpful, they sorted it out for me. They told me that the IAA is incredibly busy because of Brexit, and that we should send a request for the new page not after the last row gets signed, but when the row BEFORE the last one is signed. That will leave us with 12 months of time available for getting the page delivered.  
[2019-04-24 17:21:44] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FHU0SE0KD with text: Thought for the day;- Earth day, global warming, our company in the top ten carbon emitters in Europe, it sure can feel funny to be a carbon belching Pilot in this newborn world of suddenly responsible humans, after all everybody knows that if Trump says it’s fake, then it must be real. 

The average citizen in the U.K. generates 12-13 tonnes of Co2 emissions per year. A Tesla model 3 battery (the eco solution) generates an 11-15tonne carbon footprint between its mining and its manufacture, and it’ll be finished its life after only 94,000 miles. All very sobering, but we pilots might burn twice that in a day, or rather - you might argue - the hundreds of passengers that pay us to fly them around do. 

I can’t help but think that the fabled €9.99 flight will not stand the scrutiny of many more governments by the time even our kids are out marching against the environmental madness we have found ourselves embroiled in. In a few short years the marchers will be voters. 

The Irony is though that the €9.99 for a flight ‘sales gag’ has, along with its clear contradiction with any future for our atmosphere, sponsored an element of our global solution too, that of the fuel saving pilot. CDA’s, minimal APU burn, later configurations, optimum cruise, econ cruise, single engine taxi, idle reverse and so on. 

I recently spoke to a friend who wound up the mac number on his 777 as he flew home to a rendezvous with an old friend with a thirst. While ordering his second pint later on he realised the first one had a carbon footprint of 2.5 tonnes compliments of the extra mac it took to make it those few minutes earlier. It didn’t sit right with him, at least until the third or fourth pint - that’s 2 to 3 months of another persons annual footprint. 

Limiting fuel burn is an inevitable ingredient in our futures, it will endure beyond the €9.99 ticket at least. We might as well accept it and engage with it - judiciously as ever - bearing in mind of course that a glide approach to a fuel starved plane wreck has a fairly colossal carbon footprint, certainly enough to obliterate the efforts of any OCD styled bean counters. Non the less, we should make it our point of pride, finishing work sometimes knowing that we saved a half a tonne, even a tonne, just for the sake of a conscious effort. I reckon that will do the mind good, and a few other things besides. 

“Ah that’s just making money for yer man” you might say, well, yes, but after we finish turning him and this airline around we will want it to be a profitable and sustainable outfit, even before that though, any time we hit TOGA a few hundred kilos saved earlier in the trip is nothing short of good airmanship. 

So in my view a Pilot with an environmental conscience is not an oxymoron or a carbon crackpot. It’s just making yourself answerable to later generations when they come and ask why we trashed the place at such a rate. We might even come to ask that ourselves.

[2019-04-24 19:20:42] <ginosabatino> Absolutely spot on. I always make it my mission to taxi as efficiently as possible, not to accelerate to gain 2 knots only to brake 30 seconds later. 

To press VS when I type a new cruise altitude when descending in econ (and you know the fmc will give you a higher speed), and wind the speed bug up slowly and let gravity help me accelerate, rather than just type the new cruise altitude/speed into the fmc to have the auto throttles go up to 90% power...

I always joke with my fo’s that I enjoy being a fully paid up member of the Ray Conway Gliding Club! I love nothing more than the taps being closed from top of drop until 4miles! Being an ex-glider pilot I enjoy trying to balance off energy and speed!

[2019-04-24 19:55:54] <boston58730> I’ve been wrestling with my conscience about that for a while now. High speed = finish sooner and stick it to yer man vs Econ = save the planet and everyone on it. 
Easy choice right. Except far too often I make the ‘wrong’ one.  I will endeavour to up my game on that front and not let the team down. 

Maybe that’s why most other airlines out there reward flight crew with a small slice of the profits they generate, I know it would definitely help tip the scales for me.

Too many of us are happy just to have a job, feel grateful just to get paid like an abused wife who is happy just to have a fella at home no matter how brutally he treats her.

To be honest I’m getting fed up telling people they are worth more than that. I’m in the lucky position that I can withstand a slow continual decline in earnings. Usually the ones with their heads in the sand who can’t. 
Forgot what my point was with all this but I find SLACK therapeutic. It’s nice to know there are some intelligent, conscientious guys left out there, it’s easy to forget that sometimes.

[2019-04-24 20:26:32] <albertbessler> Great post Robin. I absolutely agree with everything you say. 

The future of our jobs rely on us being economical and environmentally aware and not because the bean counters will be on our back. 

I operate as economically as I can because it’s the socially responsible thing to do and not because I want to be top of some list. I’m long past looking for a pat on the head. 

I used to love operating out of RYG. Proper CDA, idle reverse, single engine onto stand where the ground power was plugged in F1 style, so no need for the APU. 

Sad I know but I’m easily amused these days.

Our Profession is something to be proud of, it’s a privilege, but only because we mind it. 

Now that we finally throw off the ‘jumped up taxi driver’ slur that was spat upon us for too long the level of that particular inaccuracy never ceases to disprove itself.

[2019-05-01 12:29:08] <kilroyrobin> The times they are a changing.

Last year we came with foundations, this year we must bring the rest.

The fight is tough, but not near as tough as the toll taken before it started. The stress of the fight was always less than the strain of its absence.

Last year the Dutch friend I met again yesterday was embedded in a fight with us from his EIN base, now, with little real choice he is leaving. How can I thank him for the hits he has taken, all of us accepted the risks at the start, but those who were hit were hit. How do we mark it with actions not words.

I resolved as I walked away that no Dutch Pilot in Dublin should ever come to think we have forgotten how that upstanding nation and people stood up with the few others when it counted most. The self titled ‘Dutchies in Dublin’ should be treated as our Brothers and Sisters on our Unity island, not just the straight marching fighters of 2018 but all the generations to come through our door and in their footsteps. There are plenty who talk the talk in this fight, but they walked the walk.

But it is not just the Dutch to whom we owe our respect, BRE, NRN, and will there be more?, thinly veiled concerns aired to others who stood up. We now decide how much longer this game is played. The game of threats as we know is played for both sides to loose. How anybody could have missed that basic fact in 2017 is utterly beyond me, but they did.

So how do we know, who is it among our numbers that we demonstrate the respect that they have earned and we remember? Well, that’s one we thought of earlier - it’s yellow!

Even the yellow lanyard has changed. It was always Unity. It was always, professionalism, “I am proud to fix this place, I am proud to fly our planes”, they even carry their own yellow lanyard along their hull. But now it has to be more. Respect for each other, but especially for those who have paid the price to begin a fight to win in which they can no longer benefit, but yet we who are still here can.

It is all change. It took bravery to cross the fence of fear and act as an Army in 2018, it should take none at all to do so in 2019. Our enemy is not management, it is apathy. Our company has agreed that our Unions negotiates our terms &amp; conditions now. It is not even a question any more, the reason for not acting in Unity now is no longer fear. Perhaps laziness, selfishness - apathy. There are not many here who cannot comprehend fear, but in our profession there are also not many who would entertain selfishness, apathy or laziness as points of pride. Fear is no longer the reason for any inaction. People have paid a price to make this change true.

Change is the only constant, but it seems at times only our kind of change is good. Only Unity brings our kind of change. Apathy is its equal opposite, apathy brings bean counter change. No point moaning about it, that is how it is in everything, a universal constant, if you don’t care you loose.

In all of this change it is to me disrespectful in 2019 to leave the yellow lanyard aside when all that it represents has cost so much to some of our numbers. So wear it, and as you pass a colleague of a similar mind hold up the yellow lanyard and call  it what it is. Call it “respect”. (edited)

[2019-05-02 07:23:42] <boswellbrown> Only yesterday here on sunny planet BRS! 
[2019-05-02 08:13:03] <maassen.maik> At least 500 of the 1000 yellow lanyards must have left the company with their owners or been put aside. Whenever I travel around the network, I see close to none.
Maybe it has to do with the unions' apathy... 
[2019-05-02 08:57:08] <kilroyrobin> The Yellow Lanyard and the reality of its attached risks may need a little mentoring I suppose on the proverbial walk to the car park after a good day’s work. It is afterall the first public step for many. 

Several Pilots have been sacked in this fight, but they were all council members, and most were in the early days of the fight with the most notable being Captain Olav Leeman who’s contract was terminated the same day our CLA was signed, 23rd of August 2018. He was a VC council member and continued to operate as RTPG Secretary even after loosing his job. A brave and exceptional character who brought immeasurable change. 

Donning a lanyard however is not even in the same risk Galaxy as Olav was cruising. Captain Leeman took his ship light years ahead of this conversation. We are in a totally different risk universe here in our conversation on the humble but important yellow lanyard. 

Outside of Council members it is fair to say that yes Bases were attacked, but individuals kept themselves in line with the others and were not picked off. In all the strikes in Ireland - 5 in total - including multiple marches right past the large windows of HQ, rain or shine, with senior management leaning out of cars on the roundabout filming all present - not one person lost their Job. 

We were careful, nobody on probation, no contractors, we crossed the T and dotted the i,  it was a time for absolute professionalism. But so is every day for us in reality. 

We only picked the fights we knew we could fight as a group, “we don’t do martyrs in the Union” we said, and ultimately we watched out for each other, no high emotions, no off the cuff emails, it’s no place for emotional outbursts. None of these challenges are strangers to professional pilots though. 

No yobs here. 

Following the normal disciplines required of a pilot is all that is needed to make industrial action safe, or very safe if you compare it to how things were before when we served our time here as lone mercenaries where one false move left you fully exposed and alone, if worried about fear then expect to find it right there - back where we were. 

We heard a good bit at the start about the lanyard alright, “oh you’re joining the lemmings being lead off the cliff are you....” when asked we just said it means I am proud to fly this plane and I am proud to help fix this airline. It is not an anti Ryanair lanyard, it is deliberately picked from the company colours. We want this place to work, and then work better. 

I don’t understand, after all that has already been achieved, how holding that positive and professional line with any manager would be beyond an individual. No doubt though Apathy will be a common barrier for all of us in here to persistently and collectively lean on until it retreats. Apathy is our threat, the BC is not nearly as dangerous. 

Your BC will ultimately align himself with the best future for the airline, we just have to help the stragglers clear up the confusion on which direction that is, and that is exactly as stated by the company: Union recognition. 

I would say in Dublin we have a mature understanding between the Union and our BC which often involves frank and professional communication about issues we need to work together on or clarify, and of course differences where they lie, sometimes we agree and sometimes we don’t but that does not change the tone or the temper. It has become a matter of fact engagement. 

If Dublin is the heart of the FR empire it should naturally operate as a template for the smaller kingdoms of the wider network. I would say that does not always happen, but for all sides concerned it should. 

It’s funny though, although it weighs the same as any other you notice folks do tend to have the head held that bit higher.

[2019-05-02 08:57:57] <kilroyrobin> As for the old upgrade chestnut, well, I have seen yellow Lanyards worn right through the upgrade course with trainers from both sides and by people who are Captains now. Most LTCs in Dublin wear the yellow Lanyard. The CU courses held in HQ are no strangers to the Lanyard either. All that’s called for from the wearer is professionalism, and we all needed that anyway.

[2019-05-02 09:03:30] <damiano.detomassi> Apathy no. We work as hard if not harder than before at a less public level . It is a phase of negotiations so seems less “revolutionary “ but as a day1 yellow lanyard guy I assure you, it’s not apathy at all. The problem of yellows leaving and not many new one coming in (coming from failed airlines , no job, different mentality) is significant and I propose a new yellow lanyard distribution campaign .

[2019-05-02 09:09:18] <masterharkin> We have full defacto approval to wear yellow lanyards. The only restriction in the Ryanair uniform policy regarding same is that there can be no branding on your lanyard other than that of sponsored companies. A plain yellow lanyard is perfectly acceptable and is within the remit of our uniform policy and that should be pointed out to that particular individual. I hope fear is not creeping into our Pilot body again.

[2019-05-02 09:22:21] <kilroyrobin> Unions are driven by members, this is the reality unfortunately, but also that is as it must be, they are a democracy, but they are not ‘autonomous cars’. We cannot sit in the back and ask are we there yet. You have to take the driver seat and turn the key. Not only that but there is often someone already dozing in the seat that you have to haul out to make room for progress. Unions are one of the most imperfect entities you can imagine, chaotic, full off different interests, fighters, hot heads and the totally un motivated cruisers and seat fillers, you find them all. The raw fact of the matter is Unions are the only legal vehicle of change available. In a lonelife raft in mid ocean we cannot complain that we want a better raft, we can only fix the one we have. Our raft is constantly disintegrating under our feet by its very nature. Stress levels are high, hours are ridiculous, people serve their time and step back, it’s a revolving door of effort. We don’t have the billions that the opposition throw at the fight. But look at the industry as a whole and you see that where our Pilots leave in order to go to better employment are those airlines where the members are driving the Union. Our RTPG President Enda Ryan did exactly this in BALPA. A lot of scruffs and collars were tossed aside before he got to the drivers seat, but he has it. This is an absolutely incredible achievement, the only thing more incredible would be if his members didn’t follow through by doing their part. Apathy in the U.K. now, given what is doable now, would be nothing short of incredible.

[2019-05-03 13:14:50] <robwatts99> It's a very fine line. I got instructed to stop by dub tower as vacating aircraft stopped on E3 (but runway vacated). We stopped,vacated and called ops. Was told to get back in queue to depart. Then ops called back and as was safety related CVR required so back to stand. As it turns out we initiated RTO prior to 80kts call aircraft peaked at 81kts. If we had of departed would have been contrary to inspection requirement which was completed with CVR change. Lesson learnt for me. Anywhere close to 80kts and back to stand. I can imagine the phone call had no inspection been done.

[2019-05-03 14:39:13] <ginosabatino> The more I think about this the more it annoys me...I have been lucky so far and have not had to call “STOP” so am pretty certain if I need to do it around the 80kt mark I would like a moment of reflection afterwards

To chat with fo, is he ok, what had happened, is it solved.
How are my cabin crew and pax? Few mins to chat with them. 
Liase with ATC. 

Aircraft state? Totally incorrect state for take off now, do we have fuel, are we at a different intersection now and re do performance. Re-run the after landing flow, before taxi flow before take off checks. 

And the chief pilot complains about a 15min delay, and probably next week about percieved time pressure? 
Does he want them to taxi immediately back to holding point and press toga again? 

As a commander, I will take as much time as I see fit. 

Let operations worry about time from the comfort of their desk whilst drinking tea.

[2019-05-03 14:53:16] <boston58730> Had an unscheduled A/C change few weeks back in PL due to inbound company had Overwing Lght annunciation in flight. Got to the aircraft and a FR engineer who had been called in from home told me and showed me he had fixed the problem but the genius at Maintrol wouldn’t let him close the HIL. 

I called said genius and he advised me he didn’t want to risk me aborting a Takeoff and would rather be “safe than sorry”. Told him if the delay went over 3 hours I wouldn’t lie on the ASR and would state he grounded a serviceable aircraft.

2 hours delay waiting for a cabin crew member to fly in. 

(It wasn’t the infamous kiwi) Don’t know what’s going on at maintrol now. They used to know their stuff. (edited)

The company's response should be, Okay so this event has happened how can we help this crew so that this doesn't happen again. Instead it's we're going to parade this crew around the network to embarrass them as much as we can, and give all the other crews around the network more 'perceived' stress and concerns to deal with as they make difficult decisions day to day

[2019-05-05 21:01:28] <marconania> Hi! I cannot find the sickness procedure anywhere.. any suggestions? I have called in sick via ipad for tomorrow morning a couple of hours ago but still pending according to the app.
Thanks in advance :wink: 
[2019-05-05 21:05:17] <damiano.detomassi> The app and the netline aren’t connected anymore . They see you called sick but the pending won’t change . I queried it . This is stupid as forces us to call anyways .... 
	:+1: marconania, coolhand787, tomflood737, mischa_buijs
[2019-05-05 21:05:43] <damiano.detomassi> Make sure they send you a netline screenshot proving its a sick and not a U/A .  
[2019-05-05 21:47:29] <arnaud2cagny> It stays at pending but they get it, however it s no proof for you they received it, send and email to <mailto:dubcrew@ryanair.com|dubcrew@ryanair.com> advise of absence and reason and a screenshot that the sick form is unavailable.

[2019-05-06 08:10:05] <arnaud2cagny> Make sure you keep a record of the sickness form unavailable with screenshot 
[2019-05-06 09:19:14] <bkehoe00> If you check the IDP it’ll have changed to U/SICK once they receive the notification of sickness from the crew app so no need to call if that’s changed. Once cert received it’ll changed to S/SICK. 
[2019-05-06 09:51:16] <damiano.detomassi> Partially correct . My day 1 stayed Usick even after I sent S and C after . Never changed . Netline changes so I requested a screenshot . This is totally against the reason we have an app...

[2019-05-07 07:35:04] <k2evvv> Yes, I am 5'8 &amp; slim. I got a small and it's a little baggy but probably right if worn with the jacket also. Hope that helps 
[2019-05-07 08:06:44] <jfsimons> Mines enroute let ya know... 
[2019-05-07 08:28:27] <avantongil> I usually use M size for everything. I ordered it but for me it's quite tight, even over the shirt only. I asked them if it could be exchanged for a L size. So... 
[2019-05-07 08:32:50] <bkehoe00> I'm quite tall and usually wear medium in things, risked medium with the winter jacket and its perfect. I don't wear it with the regular jacket though so just over the shirt/jumper. I imagine if I wore the tunic and winter jacket it may feel a little tight. Its actually quite a decent jacket! 
[2019-05-07 09:05:27] <boston58730> I’ll wear it when it’s free Shane. Not paying postage, packaging, admin or anything else. Already spent the 5k on license fees, laundry, SIM HOTAC and food/water. Otherwise I’ll wear the one I own. 
[2019-05-07 10:05:38] <philip.ardagh> Most of the cadets in the crew room have one. I grabbed a few and tried them on. Went for an M.

[2019-05-07 12:28:59] <swfmcmanus> It's on the piece of paper on the bar trolley that they scan with the vpos to load the bar info into it.

It'll say the code on it at the bottom of the list.

None of us had a clue until we did a bit of investigation the other morning. 
[2019-05-07 12:33:04] <pnelson377> :point_up: 
[2019-05-07 12:34:07] <michaelpbourke82> The piece of paper left on our bar trolley the other day was for a different flight on a different plane. I called ops, they told me to call station, called station and they told me to call ops, called ops again and eventually got it sorted. There’s pretty much zero info on it and it seems the cabin didn’t receive any FCI or memo about it. 
[2019-05-07 12:34:27] <damiano.detomassi> Very dangerous, but the FCI is there , they just don’t read it . (edited)
[2019-05-07 12:54:00] <padawa> Same here, no idea what I was talking about, had to show them on the iPad what the codes where, then we stood searching the galley for the code, then we had a discussion about if the duty free meant the alcohol and cigarettes or the perfumes and gifts etc. ?! Really clear concise communication from the company as usual! 
[2019-05-07 13:16:36] <andy.airamerica> What is this code in the galley? Will it say s19 somewhere? My number 1 came to me yesterday with I think a 7 digit number and said that’s the configuration :man-shrugging:

[2019-05-07 13:49:39] <fergus.cassidy> The early or late shift could be duty free but the trolleys are generally loaded for the whole day with duty free even if only 1 sector is duty free. 
[2019-05-07 14:13:20] <derekfdoyle> I did the Canaries today. Bar paperwork showed S19a + ACE TFS LPA FUE.  Cabin crew gave us a mystified look when we asked them. 
[2019-05-07 14:17:00] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FJ51X5JE7 with text: A Uniform marks an Army out for all to see, friend or foe. 

It may well be that as Pilots we must fight our worst fights two by two, but it is as an Army that we must march to control the road that leads to those events with the mindset of the Pilot and not that of the bean counter. Prevention is better than cure to us. To the bean counter outlying events are simply profit or loss, to a Pilot these events define our profession. Never the Twain’s shall meet - unless we make them, and so this fight is just as much the measure of the Pilot as their next landing may be. 

We are informed of our Uniform policy, and it is enforced by management pilots from time to time, but higher up there seems to be little concern as to whether we rock up in a T-shirt and jeans or not, perhaps this betrays an underlying agenda to downscale the public perception of our respected profession. 

Anybody could call ours an easy job except those who do it. This deliberate misconception benefits everyone except those who must deal only with reality. It’s good for the salesman, the HR man, the accountant, but these people profit as much from lies as from truth. Pilots on the other hand must live, learn and survive on the truth alone. You can’t bullshit the airplane, it responds only to the physics of the moment. Physics is truth and it is from there a Pilot is borne. 

We are not jumped up Taxi drivers, we are stand up Pilots. Attempts to devalue our profession have often lead to the downtrodden look so common to our particular group of sometimes weary Pilots. In the view of your Company Council we should now turn this around completely. Management Pilots have tried to smarten us up, perhaps also wary of the reciprocal agenda, but there is no power like Unity. Together we pilots of all ranks should address this issue once and for all. We hereby call for the yellow lanyards to be framed by a full Uniform in future as a show of our resilience and determination. The Uniform as we already know represents professionalism and not a bunch of parading peacocks as the other side of the table so hungrily put it at the sniff of even more money. 

When we organised the pickets of 2018 we told ourselves in preparation that as Pilots our discipline comes from ourselves and from our profession, we insisted that it does not come from the very particular brand of discipline that we were there to fight. Senior Union officials with decades of experience informed us that our pickets were the best organised that they had seen. We were immaculately turned out, and we behaved impeccably. We now believe that we should carry this spirit from the picket line and back onto the line where it began. We are calling for full Uniform to become the natural extension of the Yellow Lanyard and all that it represents. 

The Yellow Lanyard stands for the pride we take in flying these planes, the pride we take in fixing this airline, and our respect for those who have paid the price in this fight. The Uniform should also represent our fight for our profession in the very same way because the attack on our profession here has taken a greater toll than ever before. Now we must take back what we lost. 

These so called ‘largely automated’ planes do not fly themselves. It seems the simplicity of that most basic point has not yet been fully understood in the halls of power and the company continues to pay the price for this fundamental failing. They weather the storm of boom and wait patiently for bust to feed on us again, just as they did before. But it was different before. 

Now we are not only individuals, we are an army of professionals bonded by our common understanding of the need for change. Yes we used this boom to build our strength, but we are an Army now and will remain so in both boom and in bust, and so the Uniform must mark the unity and strength we have when we are combined instead of divided as some so keenly intended. This after all is just as it is in any other Army, but this one is ours.

Goes to show, it’s the stature of the person who asks and how they ask it rather than some pissant who threatens from an office somewhere.

Safe Flight.

[2019-05-08 16:42:13] <kilroyrobin> Thank you for the kind words Serks. I didn’t  wear mine for about as long as you at one time, then I dug it out for the LTC interview in 2013 and the panel across the table chortled heartily about how they knew I must be keen when I had finally dug the long lost blazer out. John Goss was always in full uniform right through the thick of everything, when he was at war he was invariably an absolute statesman to behold. Great dignity and composure. Closer to the fight now I think we are closer to his wisdom too. Tom Flood and I were both very much inspired by John Goss, and all the others too, Martin Duffy, Ted Murphy, Evert Van Zwol. Now that we own what the uniform represents again, now that I understand that this is OUR uniform I feel completely different about it, Tom Flood got there before me on this, he has always understood it, but I had a roundabout or two to take before I truly got here on this, but I’m here now let me tell you. We are all here now, we might as well show it.

[2019-05-08 17:00:34] <noelintogher> Originally I thought it was great that RYR in general were relaxed about wearing the jacket and tie. We weren’t peacocks after all. It was only a couple of years ago it clicked. The closer to the taxi drivers uniform we got then the closer to his pay and conditions we were moving. It’s good to see the trend reversing.

[2019-05-09 09:38:11] <justincharbon> Morning all, little question. Bit of hectic day yesterday and apparently I forgot to submit my OPT output for a flight. Then you receive this lovely email day after stating you did forget. Question tho, what do they expect? Send it delayed? (edited)

[2019-05-09 09:45:39] <boston58730> Working on a new contract where each transgression is penalized with a $1,000 fine. 

Enjoy these freebies while they last. 
[2019-05-09 09:55:49] <fergus.cassidy> I’ve sent it before the following day when it didn’t upload the first time. Only knew because the verified flight email was missing one sector for my logbook. 
And seeing as they’ve delayed 21st century working conditions as long as they have a few late verified flights will do no harm anyway. 
[2019-05-09 10:15:11] <justincharbon> The verified flight info they all have, the OPT data is missing, which has an automatic date. If I would send it today it could get mixed up with today’s operated flights I guess. On the other side the FO should have submitted all opt info, it just misses my signature.
But then as they don’t state in the email what they want me to do, then I can’t do nothing (edited)
[2019-05-09 10:23:05] <fergus.cassidy> Sorry, misread your post, OPT needs to be on the operating day so no point in sending now. Probably an automated email so no response necessary. 
[2019-05-09 10:24:49] <brendanjacobs> You can change the date on the last page before submitting  
[2019-05-09 10:24:55] <masterharkin> Do the following:

1. iPad settings manually change date to yesterday.
2. Re-populate yesterday’s OPT and enter a time appropriate for the flight.
3. Send. (edited)

[2019-05-12 09:19:21] <grahamkendall13> Thought it was just me. Did nothing different but started getting emails... 
[2019-05-12 09:21:48] <iglehane> The landing dispatch performance deletes itself when you do the final takeoff figures. I enquired and that’s the reason I was getting the missing ELS data email. 
[2019-05-12 09:22:25] <grahamkendall13> I thought it was maybe that but it’s showing on the sent email... 
[2019-05-12 09:29:29] <gustav.andregard> Same for me, not been any issue up until 2 days ago so seems strange, well let's try again, then let HQ go through the mails and tell me what they complain about.... Make the puppets work a bit 
[2019-05-12 09:31:30] <tomflood737> As Ian says - the landing dispatch has to be executed every time you go into W and B, I always execute before I send the takeoff dispatch, but still get the odd email.  
[2019-05-12 09:43:23] <jorgelucca> I started getting the emails 2 days ago. I’m 100% sure all the data was in.

[2019-05-12 09:50:56] <grahamkendall13> Perceived data was in?

[2019-05-12 10:16:32] <cormac_w> Same here last two days both sets of flights had missing ELS data.Haven’t changed my way of doing it so :man-shrugging: 
[2019-05-12 10:40:18] <derekfdoyle> I queried it a few months ago but got a reply two weeks later that the query had been “automatically solved”.  I started getting the emails again two days ago. 
[2019-05-12 12:51:40] <tomdavies737> I sent the following email this morning. I received what appears to be a generic email reqarding missing data. After reviewing the emails that I sent I cannot see what information is missing. In order that all regulatory information is included can you be more specific as to the information that is missing? For example:

Flight Nunber missing? or Flight Crew, Cabin Crew Numbers missing?
DUB-AGP FR7054  EI-DLH  69990 CREW 2/4 2019-05-11 16:23
AGP-DUB FR7055  EI-FZS  69990 CREW 2/4  2019-05-11 20:28

e-Signature not authenticated? I would ask can the data be sent if the incorrect password is used? If yes, then why?

With a headache you don't really go to the emergency service to ask for a note:thinking_face:.

[2019-05-13 08:54:19] <brendanjacobs> Shit things: New ‘improved’ staff travel, just implemented, no negotiation. New ‘attendance’ policy, just implemented, no negotiation. New ground transport policy, just implemented, no negotiation. 
Better things: New staff travel app, must be part of negotiated agreement. New improved (not what we want, but better than the month off) annual leave system, must be negotiated. 
I’m sure there’s a lot more but it’s very obvious that anything that results in a degradation of our conditions is simply implemented “with immediate effect”, yet anything that actually improves our lives must be dragged through a protracted and bordering on impossible process, where the words ‘no basis in reality’ are used as a universal excuse to simply impede and frustrate. 
The softer approach that allegedly came with ‘union recognition’ is nothing more than a quote for the media. The conditions we live with have actually gotten worse, not as a result of ‘union recognition’ but as a determined consequence of a management team hell bent on maintaining control. 
The share price is still falling and there haven’t even been any strikes threatened. It’s time everyone woke up and forced a change.

[2019-05-13 09:40:29] <kilroyrobin> “Up to a maximum of up to five months” .... they love writing ‘up to’ so much they don’t even see it in there twice in one sentence, (sorry I mean ‘up to’ 18 times in one sentence)....Up to 20%, up to 200grand, up to 18hrs a week, ‘up to’ HQ now whether we start an honest conversation at last.  
[2019-05-13 09:45:27] <ramseyersimon> That’s pretty draconian, but the language used and the tone are even more worrying. 
[2019-05-13 09:50:37] <kilroyrobin> A Doctor is €55, most people are sick a few times a year.  
[2019-05-13 09:56:48] <fergus.cassidy> The only safety system they see in HQ is cost. Their gate bust criteria is " will this cost us money" they have totally forgotten there own statement "SAFETY IS OUR UTMOST PRIORITY"

[2019-05-13 11:50:43] <swfmcmanus> That's a fair point... A person may deem themselves unfit for 1-2 days but a doctor could recommend taking the 5 off to be on the safe side.

Thanks  
[2019-05-15 09:05:39] <gmulcair99> It’s been a while since I had a birdstrike - but I think when you select “Birdstrike” on the SAIR a birdstrike section opens up in the SAIR report asking for details...... unless this has changed.

[2019-05-15 09:35:53] <fergus.cassidy> That's all it is. It automatically opens a bird strike inspections form. If it asked what type of bird, size etc that was it. 
[2019-05-15 09:38:49] <derekirl> Yeah that’s it so , thanks Lads .Only short of asking if the bird had a name !

[2019-05-15 18:39:21] <arpadheger1977> :point_up_2: watch out for this one! Let‘s make an educated guess what Ryanair REALLY wants it for 
	:100: jgrooney
[2019-05-15 19:13:20] <kilroyrobin> Well, personally I think this could provide ourselves with a strong ability to self brief. If you get close to a margin you can see how close exactly rather then rubbing your chin and saying, well I guess they’ll ring me if it was too close. I can see benefits, but one line that catches my attention is this “the airline wants pilot life-long learning to reach new heights” now is that a 4 year life, or a full career. Is this the first time I have read a Ryanair reference to the idea that your growing experience can continue to deliver advantage and learning as you mature as a pilot, or that experience has value??!! In which case I welcome this also.  
	:100: bmcloughlin970
[2019-05-15 19:15:43] <remco.spelt> Some paragraphs with my personal opinion/thoughts (I might see it from a pessimistic side) , as always we have to read those kind of things in press before we (as ryranair pilots) gave feedback or opinion:face_with_rolling_eyes:

-  CEFA Aviation’s flight replay will set new standards for delivering constructive feedback to our crews in a way that would have been impossible to imagine  without the innovative approach to secure data processing that has been delivered by CEFA Aviation’s team”.

Them or Ryanair (as 1st and biggest costumer in EU) will set the standards?

- Over the next 12 months we will monitor pilot performance based on an agreed set of KPI’s to ensure that our pilots not only deliver to the highest standards of safety and efficiency in the industry but set new standards of excellence for the years ahead” .

Captains only? De-identified information, GDPR? KPI’s like apu run time have nothing to do with safety, neither gear down after 4nm?

-  are proud to initiate a change designed to revolutionize not only the debriefing and training culture within the company, but also for European aviation, thus making the sky safer,” says O’Shea.

More ofdm meetings? Training culture? 

-  For Ryanair, it is essential to bring back flight data and make it understandable and easily accessible to the people who should always be able to review it in the first line, namely the pilots. Access to data gives a strong and positive signal from the company as a real proof of confidence from the airline towards its pilots. With CEFA AMS, the airline wants pilot life-long learning to reach new heights and for this, aims at achieving three goals: strengthen pilot training efficiency; harmonize pilots’ skill levels as they join from airlines with different SOPs and reduce time and costs spent in line training while always building and improving flight safety.

with which intention, to really make us better or "punish" when not flying an CDA, LDA? Proof of confidence and positive signal from Ryanair? (edited)

[2019-05-15 19:48:27] <boston58730> Like the guys above said, who agreed the KPI’s?

The technology is not the problem. It’s the guys who implement it. After all is said and done though, the OFDM is already capturing the data and reporting it back to big brother. This system is basically a ‘front end’ which allows playback on the IPAD as well as the Flight Replay software in the crew room.

Like Remco though I would like to know if both crewmembers would have access to the playback.

[2019-05-15 22:17:15] <coolhand787> It’s a direct bypass of OFDM protocol IMHO. This way RYR has direct access to our flight profiles. Another way to monitor flights without our consent!  
[2019-05-15 22:22:16] <coolhand787> Well knowing RYR management I see it as a direct bypass of OFDM protocol IMHO. This way RYR has direct access to our flight profiles. Another way to monitor flights without our consent and possibly get data to ‘accuse’ captains. I am very skeptical on RYR transparency, just culture and GDPR protocol. Like previously stated, I think it essential that a dedicated trusted and confidential team of pilots are the buffer between this data and the company! This is to prevent data abuse.

[2019-05-16 05:18:00] <spac> Once it's in situ, the unions will have absolutely no recourse to have the system controlled, nor to have any say in how the information is used.
The company has shown an utter disregard for the GDPR - remember the LEMG cabin crew? - it has an utter distrust/disregard for pilots and cabin crew.

While our unity is precious, those who showed us how to use it must also never be forgotten. I remember *Simon Croghan* and *Alan Brereton* there with us in the IRCC from the very start and right through the very toughest of it, just as they were there with all of you in Ireland at those meetings where we all needed to understand the game we were there to play, if we didn’t know the rules of play we would not have won. One more thing I love? the ability to repay my debt of gratitude to the Union’s very best when election time comes around. Don’t forget to vote folks, it matters.

[2019-05-17 18:03:09] <derekirl> Done &amp; in the Post back  
[2019-05-17 19:05:00] <derekfdoyle> Already posted. I sent Alan Brereton off on his first solo many years ago, it makes me feel very old. 
[2019-05-17 19:48:51] <kilroyrobin> Wow I didn’t know that, just as well you made him a Pilot.  
[2019-05-17 21:17:37] <tomhic> I'm an IALPA member over 6mnts. I've handed in my details in person to Danni however I've never received an email or ballot from the Union. Only for this social outlet I wouldn't know where my subs go. I'm one of many and this to me is the Unions weakest link 
[2019-05-17 21:36:22] <arnaud2cagny> Have not received it yet although, but if I don't by Tuesday I ll call Danni, most Mon to Friday 0900-1630 expect bank holidays, meetings days etc : 01 844 52 72, have you been to the last meeting about pay proposal@TomHickey? Are you aware of the accident/incident training paid by IALPA or negotiation training funded by IALPA, or the lawyer fees involved in our fight? lately our union negotiate an interim agreement that brought pay rises while still being able to negotiate better terms and conditions rather than being stuck in an agreement for the next 5years, not bad. Have you heard about the FORSA team, the spokesman etc they all have a cost, have you heard of the 5th column? (edited)

---- 2019-05-18 ----
[2019-05-18 03:11:18] <kilroyrobin> Tom I am sorry you have not received communications from IALPA. I will answer your question on where your subs go in a later post. It will take time to explain everything as the Ryanair campaign was the most expensive part of the IALPA operation for 2018. The change we have brought is fundamental, let me know if newer members would like that change explained too please as you mention you are not alone in this question which is worrying to me. All members need to be informed and it’s possible the newer ones are not. Thank you for your post.  
[2019-05-18 15:34:20] <arpadheger1977> Despite the fact what a lot of us often think about Ryanair....

Respect to Ray Conway and the LTN BC this time for not pushing -just for the sake of even more Automation- the VNAV Departures! Good decison IMHO. Well done:+1::skin-tone-3: 
	:+1: hrvojesucic, pcerutti, jgrooney, derekfdoyle, kilroyrobin, swfmcmanus, boston58730, polboix, rogierbrink, ginosabatino, willemvandijke, laurent_lebrun, max_palm, justincharbon, coolhand787, jolmervanbrakel, robertwasilewski
[2019-05-18 15:43:46] <andy.airamerica> Good decision based on the memo. But what to dozens of other operators who do VNAV departures do to mitigate the threats mentioned in the memo? 
[2019-05-18 15:49:43] <marjus1> Increased workload (OPT plus the VNAV brief and checking) Should be mitigated against by including more time in turnaround. There used to be a time when we didn’t have to RFS, OPT. All these things came in with no adjustment for the turnaround time. Plus massive OTP pressures, plus slow flight deck preparation and briefing (Trg) makes for holes in the cheese. IMO.  
[2019-05-18 15:50:06] <damiano.detomassi> Having used VNAV on ground for 5+ years while on BBJ the excuses on the memo are mostly that ....excuses. The last issue of the QNH i partly agree with , and the fact that we have repeatable and proven sop already makes the change probably not fundamentally important just yet . (edited)
[2019-05-18 16:31:27] <arpadheger1977> Did it in my previous company as well. It is what it is... overloading and reducing situational awareness significantly without any reasonable benefit. A lot of room to make mistakes when not setting up the FMC properly combined with 25min turnaround... no, but thanks no! Just my two cents...  
[2019-05-18 16:40:29] <damiano.detomassi> You have a good point . I don’t mind our current ;-)  
[2019-05-18 16:58:51] <tuhhodge> I agree. At least the present system requires brain engagement and direct involvement of the pilots. 
[2019-05-18 16:58:58] <marjus1> I think that’s probably a bit blunt. Did you do 25 minute turnaround 12-15 times per week on the BBJ? There’s nothing wrong with the VNAV process per se, it’s the context within which it is happening combined with all the other tasks required and risks identified that raises concerns. 
	:+1: robertwasilewski
	:point_up: robertwasilewski
[2019-05-18 17:08:20] <damiano.detomassi> BBJ means uncontrolled field in Africa and Asia or small islands in pacific with big boss showing up with Harley Davidson to be put on the forward sofa while we have an oceanic slot expiring and our duty hours going to soon as well . Add military curfew and uncharted mountains on departure , VNAV departure helped with one less thing to worry about (yes we had only 6 BBJ and we didn’t have to worry about too many software errors like here with all the different versions ) . The standardization of a big airline should be the protection here and should allow to make full use of Boeing provided equipment . The fact that it is not and the reasons they mention aren’t convincing me .
Probably the fact the the less experience pilot in my BBJ gig was 4500tt and 2000 on type made the difference . 
[2019-05-18 17:10:26] <marjus1> Your last sentence; that’s the thing.  
[2019-05-18 17:11:05] <damiano.detomassi> And that is why I don’t buy the excuses they put in that memo.  (edited)
[2019-05-18 17:11:47] <marjus1> Ok 
[2019-05-18 17:53:15] <endaryan> Wow here was me thinking the LTN pilots who took part in this trial and gave honest feedback were our colleagues?? I must have missed something. :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
[2019-05-18 18:52:08] <damiano.detomassi> Mentally I am always prone to think management ignores the feedback and decides on their own so I probably bypassed that bit . Apologies to anyone involved . 
Personally gave 3 feedbacks on OPT recently (used it for a decade before here and ours falls short in various areas ) received just “noted “ or excuses to why it’s better like this. So feedback part is hard to believe . Preconceptions. (edited)

[2019-05-18 21:09:22] <tomhic> Thanks Robin I've been a union member/rep not always IALPA for many a year. I completely understand how our subs are distributed @Arnaud de Cagny.  The point I'm making ref subs is if IALPA can set up a direct debit then the individual should automatically recieve feedback for his/her membership in form of correspondence/communication. 
I have the utmost respect to all our representatives past/present and they have my total support. Apologies if the word subs distracted the meaning of my original post.

[2019-05-18 22:50:20] <kilroyrobin> We have had several problems with this issue Tom and it’s no harm it’s raised again. Some people only need a half an excuse to drift from the Union and I am very frustrated at how poorly this aspect is run as it’s probably a cause of loosing people who are half in or half out. We need the swing vote in with the rest to win. We have had several people not on the email list or having issues with payment applications. Unfortunately there are three components. (1) There is only one Danni and a thousand of us with hundreds of agendas. Then, when she is finished being over worked, IALPA is (for better or worse) married to FÓRSA - they have a nice war chest, sometimes that’s for better but in this particular area (Admin) it’s for worse. So (2) IALPA sends in the membership details to them and it goes into a black hole of secretarial staff that then have to be chased and chased. I have raised this issue repeatedly and will do so again. (3) Unions cannot canvass for members, in broad terms they can’t approach you, you must approach them. This means that a person applies online. The Application generates a ‘prove you are not a robot’ response email. People then don’t open it, or it goes to junk. Now the Union should not contact you or that’s canvassing, so you the applicant must then contact them (I know I know, we live in an anti labour state..:face_with_rolling_eyes:, society really needs Billionaires..:face_with_rolling_eyes: and by hook or by crook our laws sure favour that faulty idea) I will raise it again and like my kids I will depend on pester power for more success this time. In the mean time can I encourage anyone else with this issue to do the same. Don’t give up. We are the financial and resources underdog, and we always will be, sometimes it shows, but sometimes we win too. Anyway being the underdogs is how you know we’re the good guys :muscle::muscle:

[2019-05-19 08:55:56] <jolmervanbrakel> We trialed the optimum flap in BRS a few years ago and also had concerns. No idea whether they were significant enough but it never happened in the end. In the case of VNAV we now know: it's been suggested, trialed, and decided not to implement - a very step in receiving and giving back feedback :+1::skin-tone-2:

[2019-05-19 09:32:32] <kilroyrobin> Thanks a Million Tom:+1: 
[2019-05-19 09:36:47] <fergus.cassidy> Some bases have actively been uninvolved in every issue. Keeping your head in the sand while others do all the hard work is not an acceptable excuse later. Even if not actively involved staff need to be aware of what is going on around them. There are some very good guys in STN but it's just too big to spread the message unless others get involved too. 
[2019-05-19 09:39:47] <ronan.walsh22> I’ve said it a hundred times before, slack is a closed loop. Recruitment from WhatsApp groups of flight deck and cabin crew should be one of the top priorities. Risky, I know but the only way to get everyone fighting the same battle.

Had dinner late last year with a friend from a U.K. Base and his friend from DUB. Question I was asked. "But what is the point of seniority? Was it really worth striking for?"  Even when I explained the responses I got were along the lines of "but I'm happy as I am" and "I'm based at home so don't really see the point". I pointed out both answers contained "I" and that not everyone happens to be so settled and that his U.K. Base is small so what happens if they close it. Response along the lines of "I guess but still don't really think it was worth the hassle".  The apathy we deal with :face_with_rolling_eyes:

[2019-05-19 10:45:54] <greggmcavan> Nail on the head their Rob.....”worth the hassle” you just have to wonder exactly would would have to happen to these people for them to begin looking beyond the end of their nose. 

I dunno, maybe with R-UK a sudden sharp FR shock of worsening Ts&amp;Cs might make them sit up at take notice, but then it’ll be “what’s balpa doing about it” to which my favourite reply at the moment “f**k all until you pay your subs” 

I get the whole “you know what you signed up to when you joined” balls and I would even allude to an amount of Stockholm Syndrome

But when the only thing that gets my lots back up is parking spaces and their sense if unjustified bollocking because they chose to park in Jet2’s car park.....I 

Dunno, maybe the departure of JG and arrival of CR might shake them up a bit 

 
[2019-05-19 11:30:36] <ronan.walsh22> If these guys and girls were consistently exposed to a ‘slack’ point of view they would soon change their tune. Get them out of narrow minded slack groups and expose them to the possibilities of their career and pitfalls of their contracts. People are not idiots but a lot are happily ill informed. Cabin crew also. Trouble is how to sign them all up?  
[2019-05-19 11:38:42] <boston58730> Some think they’re part of the winning team of capitalism, some don’t want to pay, some can’t be bothered and most are scared. 
Many say they will sign up when :o: action is announced but talk is cheap. Worst part of it is that if we win we have to take these freeloading Jellyfish (© Oliver Linde) with us. 
[2019-05-19 11:42:27] <boston58730> First reply from Bob speaks volumes though. I know the names of the 50 active guys on here by heart (where they belong). We need 10 times that number and we need them soon.

[2019-05-19 15:29:31] <kilroyrobin> To do this right there is no better way than face to face meetings, a room full of people taking on their march for the common good can never be replicated on a screen. It is a unique way to bond your strengths together, also what is said in a room is much less likely to come back and drag the speaker in to court than the written word. Especially in bigger bases it is effective. Again it’s a question of resources though, it is very time consuming, we probably did a hundred pilot meetings in Ireland, usually 3 a day right through from Sept 17 to the end of 18. It is also very informative to council members in reading the appetite and concerns of the members. It costs money alright, but more critically it costs over worked council members many many hours of their already ravaged free time. The solution then is more of those of us who have made it this far stepping forward to the council and saying ‘give me a job I can do to help’. Tell them what you are good at, tell them what you are willing to do and where you draw the line, that’s OK too. We here are the coffee beans. We got here to the fight first because we were born that way, we are thinkers, big picture people, that is a fact we can be proud of. However I can tell you that looking at the free loaders will only break your spirit, trust me on this. Look to the people in your council instead, move closer to them and your spirit and resolve for this fight grows stronger, trust me on that too, the brotherhood of the fight is absolutely infectious and inspiring. We here are the Coffee beans, we will always be the minority, that’s the reality of life, but in the end it’s the Coffee beans that will turn the whole steaming cup of water black and strong. The beans are the ones that change everything, wake up and smell the coffee and be bloody proud that you are it. Somewhere, no matter how deep they bury it, those who don’t have the beans know they don’t. That’s their loss. Be proud you are here, I am proud of all of us. We are not a minority swamped by a mass of deadweight loosers, we are an incredible band of Pilots who literally changed the future of our profession, we are a truly exceptional bunch of people. I am privileged that life brought me the gift of this fight, and that when it came to me I had the wisdom to see it as a gift and not a looming shadow. A chance for me to right a wrong that was gradually wearing on me for years. This is a fantastic time to be in Ryanair, a reason for why we are here in a fight so far removed from the boredom of the rat race, pity the fools who’ve missed their chance to look on themselves with that utmost prize in life, that of self respect. As everyone of us here knows that does not just belong to the leaders here, it belongs to everyone of us here who empower their voices of change.

[2019-05-20 22:20:02] <kilroyrobin> There will be a major job on now for everyone in Britain who already understands to explain to everyone else that the power of the U.K. pilot group, (due to the Ryanair pilot numbers based in the U.K. which is damn near a quarter of our total) that the entire future of the profession is now in their hands. Most of the other smaller countries laid the foundations last year, we slogged like slaves to build the Roman road. All we need now is an Army to march along it and the empire will fall. Game of thrones is over, no excuses left, if apathy wins we will loose. Each and every one of us. It’s the tipping point, come on Britain, tip it our way, and watch the others follow.  (edited)

Having been close to the heart of this from the start I have a few points of view that as I see it may not be understood by those now new to our fight. If I was a British based Pilot this morning waking up to the smell of Coffee and talk of BALPA Ballots, there are probably a few fundamentals I might like to know: these I will post by reply here:

[2019-05-21 10:29:32] <kilroyrobin> *If we strike will it work?* Well between Christmas ’17 and summer ’18 management had to back down twice, it took in both cases multiple countries with minuscule pilot numbers compared to the UK, even counting all pilots internationally who took action. The UK accounts for pretty much a quarter of the entire FR pilot body. The Idea that a BALPA negotiation that was backed by members support up to and including potential strike action could not succeed is not realistic. If a pebble can smash a windscreen there is no basis for the argument that a sledge hammer can not do the same.

*What is it for, Pay?, but why pay.* Unfortunately there has been a huge decline in pay within this company, roughly 50% over 20 years when measured against inflation. The structure of the pay as it is currently arranged is intended to facilitate an erosion against time, the proof of this concept is in what has happened here already. The principles of how pay is adjusted over time have to be addressed, not just the amount of pay. Also, while there are many more pertinent issues that could be fought for, pay has a habit of unifying people, even those who are only half interested. The half interested would never rock up for a ballot for ‘rostered union time for council members’ for example, however the half interested are the swing vote, every democratic win has to win the swing vote first. Your Council needs a democratic win, the finer points can be won at the table. 
[2019-05-21 10:30:00] <kilroyrobin> But the primary achievements of 2018 were not seniority, it was these points:

1. *Third party mediation/ Arbitration*. This means Ryanair now accepts that negotiations are held with a 3rd part independent person there who will decide who is being fair, and who is not. When your side is the fair side, mediations favours you. This was the fundamental point that took five strikes to break, this was the end to ‘take it or leave it negotiations’. This took 5 countries to break, but now it is broken.
2. *Ryanair Transnational Pilot Group* was established in 2018. In BALPA you are fundamentally connected to the other members associations across Europe in both communications and agreed protocols to address the immense complexities imposed by current EU shortfalls in labour law. This is an incredible achievement and is a foundation for everything that lies ahead now.
3. *Proof of concept*, it is now clear that you can defend your industrial rights in Ryanair, as you should in any company, and then go back to work in Ryanair having played your part in improving the company we all want to succeed. A row with the company is not the same as trying to wreck the company, no more than a fight with your partner is a divorce. Like a relationship both sides must have a voice or by default it becomes abusive. Thats just life.

The bottom line is this. As pilots ours is not just a job, it is a way of life. In our profession we must look after ourselves in order that we can mind our crew properly, from there we can mind our plane, then we can as a crew look after our passengers, but after that we must mind our profession. After all only Pilots understand our profession properly, it is only natural that it should fall to us to mind our profession as well.

That is what this is, it is not an attack, it is a defence, and it is one that falls to us to take. We take it on behalf of everyone, even the company. Airmanship is not just what we do in the flight deck, we also have to protect those who work in it. This is a one off chance to achieve a relight in our long descent. If we sit this one out in 2019 and fail then the people in the pointy end will know it most when the inevitable descent continues. 
[2019-05-21 10:38:27] <marjus1> Spot on.  
[2019-05-21 10:44:24] <marjus1> Robin, your comments should be copied and pasted to representatives within each base in the UK. For example I could post that in a closed Luton WhatsApp BALPA group. That’s my proposal. Thoughts?

I would say from his message today that Paul Kelly will be an excellent head of line training which bodes well for the maintenance of standards in our profession. We are happy to help the department protect our standards against the bean counters obsessions, and I would like to thank all LTC’s for their support in showing this message today with the yellow lanyards.

There are those who are a little less fearless and others who don’t know the rules so well when RYR tries to give you a hard time. When you know the rules you know how to put them back where they belong! This also commands respect and sometimes retaliation by BCs etc. I see some guys want to move up the RYR career ladder becoming LTC as quickly as possible and know that contradicting the company may hamper that. And here I talk of personal experience. This won’t change my attitude but it may explain the more sheepish attitude of others who have not understood the power of unity and supporting each other for example P2P. Our ball is rolling and not stoppable anymore. The staff travel, deadheading self transport and now sickness procedure are small digs at our unity. The flaws have to be found and countered. We keep fighting and Robin please keep sending your inspirational thoughts! They are awesome!

[2019-05-25 10:00:44] <spac> It's an interesting, well-penned article. For an example of crayons calling black, white, or even that up is down:

"As the court had found ... there was no defamation.

[2019-05-26 12:21:05] <dama> Great text @kilroyrobin. Did you know I keep bees? Ill be sure to bring you some homegrown honey next time I see you. :honey_pot: 
[2019-05-26 12:45:49] <kilroyrobin> Excellent, I didn’t know that, but you’re a Bee keeper in two senses now.  
[2019-05-26 13:46:29] <kilroyrobin> A man walks to the shop to buy a newspaper. As he approaches the shop front he sees a child run out into the busy traffic, he reminds himself that he is only there to buy the paper and turns away. He walks into the shop leaving the child and the traffic to resolve things themselves. Unimaginable isn’t it? un yet this happens regularly in Dublin Airport. I recently went down to asks the baggage handler to marshal, and he refused, “no I’m loading bags”. “So I’ll stop boarding then will I, can I have you name so I can explain why”, then he was suddenly able to do it and toddled off begrudgingly to save the children from a bloody doom. I don’t understand how people can get so fearful that they will look away from normal human responsibility for fear of getting chewed out by a middle manager somewhere, but they do.  They do where the management ethic is rule by fear. Every now and then I hear of inefficiencies in other companies that would wreck my head, a jet grounded for 36 hrs awaiting an iPad charger wire that could be bought in any airport shop was one that caught my attention lately. When I hear that I thank my lucky stars I work here, but only because we are here to change that culture of fear and so there is hope. The baggage handlers blind eye is a metaphor for a company wide problem where a debrief might just as likely be a threat to burn your career potential into the finest of ash rather than a constructive critique, but with the efforts of a unified work force where such a debrief is water off the proverbial duck, this place might not only survive, but even thrive.

[2019-05-29 08:24:43] <kilroyrobin> It is fitting in our fight for change that so many of the most powerful, competent and inspiring figures who helped bring change for us in our male dominated world of aviators here in Ireland were women. Captain Imelda Comer, first over the fence of fear. Then Clare Daly and Bríd Smith, heavy weight intelligent political voices who made mince meat of the panels of lesser speakers they shared prime time TV screens with on our behalf during our common fight for fair and transparent employment, and last but not least - Patricia King - a strategic mind and negotiating genius at the very top of her game, an absolute master at working peoples strengths or weaknesses for the greater good, she walked all over the worst our opposition could deliver, and they didn’t even know she was doing it.

[2019-05-29 20:12:19] <spac> It's it just me, or is there a screw loose up the food chain?
Three separate requirements today, with a combined total of 19 packages, to update the OPT.
It's there any valid reason why updates cannot be released once per week? Surely there's nothing _that_ urgent that needs promulgating? 
[2019-05-29 20:24:35] <sam.vanherzele> AIRACs are only updated every 14 days but we get new charts and performance 8 times per week... Been trying to understand that for years  
[2019-05-29 20:29:26] <jorgelucca> (dis)organizational discipline = everyone does whatever they want whenever they want because they can. 
[2019-05-29 20:42:45] <ledwithcolin> Quite a few glitches recently. The updates to fix the glitches have been causing different glitches. :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
[2019-05-29 21:42:44] <kilroyrobin> It’s beyond bonkers at this stage.  
[2019-05-29 22:11:42] <fergus.cassidy> Yet it'll be our fault in a SAFA inspection, update and screenshot it to match the previous update email you got to prove you've at least kept it up to date. 
Most if the updates are small so probably just airfield brief updates which are hardly critical. 

---- 2019-05-30 ----
[2019-05-30 00:17:33] <jgrooney> Report , no updates , depart no updates , land email and email to update , no WiFi to update . Safa check ... what happens then ? Need official clarification on this for sure . Not our fault !  
[2019-05-30 05:51:58] <martin.loxbo> What does the slack expertise say about reporting unprofessional and rude crew controllers? What is the best way to do it? This morning they wanted to give a no show for calling them back within 6 minutes. All sorted out but with much grief and stress. 
[2019-05-30 06:19:51] <robwatts99> Do most of the updates not become valid from the next day and not immediate effect? I could well be wrong but as John says we have no way to update during a duty. In fairness updates should only be put up overnight not during the day. Gets rid of any confusion.  
[2019-05-30 06:39:42] <fergus.cassidy> There shoulod be iPad charging stations in each base, which upddate the apps themselves rather than US having to it at home. They charge in the crew room. No more of those audit findings of less than 70% battery charge at reporting time.

And these updates aren't in sync either. I had 17 updates in one download for the OPT but the FO only got that update about 2 weeks later. You got 19 yesterday but I only got 2. Where is the difference in the package downloads. Are they sending out trial updates to a few and then checking the returned date before everyone receives them. (edited)

[2019-05-30 07:38:55] <kilroyrobin> They have all the tapes, if you are 100% confident that they will play strongly in your favour it could be worth raising. One expletive from you would be an own goal. Certainly it is something we should not have to put up with, but to fight it you need to be on 100% solid ground. Then if you do fight it I would do it in a ‘sandwich’ text (positive negative positive). Pad it out with a lot of ‘we are all supposed to be on the same team’ on either side of the sandwich and put your complaint in the middle. Make your complaint a constructive one focussing on the positives of improved communications etc so that you are the reasonable one. If you are currently angry about it compose your complaint and don’t send it until you are a model of calculating self control again. If you already have disciplinary proceedings against you leave it, remind yourself we’ll have to fix things on the roundabout as one of many, and walk away in favour of a fight we can win as a collective, but equally if you are on solid ground we all should hold the line by chipping away even one by one at this unnecessary erosion of normal standards of respect.  (edited)
[2019-05-30 08:29:58] <martin.loxbo> Thanks for those thoughts Robin, very well put. Do you suggest the CPTSR route or a different way? 
[2019-05-30 08:33:27] <arpadheger1977> I had a similar issue some years ago. The crew controller disturbed me in my min rest, AND he was rude. I filed an ASR. The outcome was satisfactory for me. They “de-briefed” the gentleman in crewcontrol, and we had no further issues with each other (I had further contact with him multiple times since then) (edited)

[2019-05-30 08:59:26] <kilroyrobin> There is nothing confidential in this, if you know a pilot who could benefit from it, send it on, get them involved. 
[2019-05-30 09:14:23] <kilroyrobin> I am concerned that you may not have the most solid case as we do not have a written agreement on what occurs in the event of a missed call, Arpad's case of disturbed rest was a more solid foundation for complaint. 
[2019-05-30 09:16:04] <martin.loxbo> Apparently they called another captain in the space of these 5 minutes, and even called his wife. I think it warrants an ASR. 
[2019-05-30 09:21:05] <kilroyrobin> To go in with the sledge hammer you need to be sure the floor can take it if you miss... ASR is raising it as a safety issue, I am not strictly saying it is not one, but there was no direct risk of actual injury if you know what I mean. 
[2019-05-30 09:21:58] <martin.loxbo> Safety issue is going to work agitated after this ordeal, for no reason. 
[2019-05-30 09:27:02] <kilroyrobin> Of course I see your valid point, but the ‘Personal safety’ issue here is writing the report if you are potentially still agitated. Naturally the choice is entirely yours how you proceed, which is only right as you know the full tone of the conversation. At the end of the day if nobody complains the controller will keep at it but it’s just to move deliberately and cautiously.  
[2019-05-30 09:37:33] <andy.airamerica> The funny thing is the email updates still say weekly update :joy: 
[2019-05-30 10:03:50] <arnaud2cagny> Screenshot your call history

[2019-05-30 10:26:50] <remco.spelt> Looking for some information regarding swaps:

Anyone managed to a swap outside of the ¨active roster period¨? If so how did you manage and what did you wrote to who. Thanks!:pray: 
[2019-05-30 10:34:30] <tomisalon> I have done it few times and it is rostering who does it. In my case good reason why I needed it approved in advance was enough for them to change roster to reflect as swap. (edited)

[2019-05-30 10:36:47] <remco.spelt> I will give it a try- Thanks for the quick response 
[2019-05-30 10:51:56] <martin.loxbo> Sometimes works, other times they say they don’t deal with swaps. :man-shrugging::skin-tone-2: 
[2019-05-30 14:57:55] <marmargav> Usually swap wont be processed until the active week. You will usually get the email late Thurs evening or Friday morning.  
[2019-05-30 15:42:25] <damiano.detomassi> That is something we all asked always to implement . Would make much sense  
[2019-05-30 21:57:53] <sam.vanherzele> Am I the only one who thinks it's weird how we received an e-mail on the efb stating there is no more NFZ over Etna but we never received an e-mail stating there actually was an NFZ there?

[2019-05-30 22:07:50] <padawa> I’ve swapped a couple of days about 3 weeks in advance, was when Lewis was still in rostering, they put the swaps through so it came out on planned roster, only thing was they said they couldn’t guarantee the swaps in case of illegalities nearer the time! Day before one of them I got a message off the guy id swapped with to say they’d swapped it back, I was delayed 40 minutes on day 5 late so didn’t have enough time off inbetween it and the early (swapped day) on day 2 off, so they just cancelled the swap! Called crewing and someone decent answered and just switched me onto a later flight, job done, kept the swap! Their initial reaction tho was to just cancel the swap 12hrs before just because it was the easiest option! No thought process involved, we’d obviously swapped for a reason!!

There are plenty of studies on the negative effects, notably that shift work has been classified as a probable carcinogenic by the WHO. 

A simple solution is to allow those who would like to work a fixed early/late pattern.

Many was the time we the leaders he inspired used his quotes as our members in turn had to learn the ways of the union fight. Pick your leaders, and then follow them. I hope you will write the you’re quite above to him as a letter from the RTPG.

[2019-06-03 18:37:04] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FKA2A0G9L with text: In a recent crewdock uniform policy publication there was a clerical error that said an FO should wear 3 bars after 500hrs instead of after 1500hrs as it always was, can anyone remember where I read that this error was corrected? It’s a bit misleading for flight crews, both the FO’s who might unknowingly follow that criteria, and for captains who may be misled into delegating inappropriate duties for experience level in a given case.... or have I misunderstood things and we have actually upped our pilot body experience levels by a thousand hours with the stroke of a pen, at first glance anyway... You can’t tell a book by the cover I know, but In reality there is of course one of the greatest differences in anyone’s career because of the gradient of the learning curve wedged into that particular 1000hr difference in question here. 
[2019-06-03 18:46:10] <brendanjacobs> A ‘re-issue’ was published on crewdock to correct the typo. The re-issued memo still contained the same typo!:face_with_rolling_eyes:

[2019-06-03 18:46:21] <gabriele.plancher> Saw the new uniform policy together with the memo stating about a typo error, but actually nothing got changed. 
I used to know that the old policy was 1500hrs or 1 year after initial line check (correct me if I’m wrong), but now it just looks they “downgraded” the requirement  
[2019-06-03 18:49:48] <kilroyrobin> Correct Gabriele, that’s what it was, and that it is then too.  
[2019-06-03 19:01:42] <brendancianmurphy> All the bean counters see is that they need 1 unit in the left seat and 1 unit in the right seat. they couldn’t give a fuck about the rest. (edited)
[2019-06-03 19:30:40] <bkehoe00> The typo according to the powers that be is that the original memo said Senior FO was 500hrs, now corrected to say it’s that they’re an ‘experienced FO’. Official line is now indeed that 500hrs is 3 stripes.  
[2019-06-03 19:42:48] <masterharkin> Na they are two different things.
I think the confusion here is “an inexperienced” First Officer and when you wear “3 stripes”. 
An inexperienced FO is a FO that has not completed 500 hrs in Ryanair. The correct time to wear 3 stripes is 1 year from *your last* line-check during line training (the 3 month line-check) or for a direct entry FO 1500 total time. (edited)
[2019-06-03 19:46:44] <masterharkin> @kilroyrobin I love your “special” yellow braiding on that epaulette but he/she should be wearing that colour long before that :wink:. 
[2019-06-03 19:46:45] <bkehoe00> Unfortunately that’s the old policy Stephen. They’ve ‘harmonized’ then to be the same. Our BC was closely involved in the new :hankey: policy and has specifically been asking FOs why they haven’t got their 3 stripes yet!  
[2019-06-03 19:49:53] <masterharkin> WTF honestly? When I had 500 hrs I was still flying a single engine trying not to kill myself. That’s now called experienced :man-shrugging:. 
[2019-06-03 19:52:47] <kilroyrobin> Looks like Stephen is right, the yellow lanyard will have to show us who’s got ‘the right stuff’ in future.  
[2019-06-03 20:28:37] <paulkgriffin> Yeah think Ops A manual confirms that 500 hours or about 5 months since type rating is experienced!! 
So no limitations with crosswind landings?!
Great so the new SFO can do the 230/Gusting 49 onto Rwy28 no problem! :face_with_rolling_eyes: 
[2019-06-03 21:04:53] <boston58730> OMA 8.3.0.3.1 “cross winds approaching limiting values can present significant handing challenges. In these circumstances it is prudent for the aircraft commander to act as pilot flying.”

[2019-06-03 21:43:51] <coolhand787> Gents I know about all the regulations but the bottom line is that RYR is again engaged at window dressing. Just pretending and diluting a proof lack of experience caused by what... a problem of crew retention! Of course it’s not Rys’s Management’s fault... And regardless of the experience if something goes amiss it’s the commanders fault anyway! So remain vigilant at all time and Happy Landings

[2019-06-03 21:47:15] <neilsutherland> I think autocorrect kicked in on O'leary's phone when he wrote this memo, the policy should actually read:
2 stripes - being fucked over on a bullshit sham contract whilst shackled to a 5 year training bond.
3 stripes - paid correctly.

[2019-06-04 09:57:01] <damiano.detomassi> I think all they wanted is to give a visual indication to the Cpt quickly to who can land what . Am I naive ? In Alitalia we used to have 1 stripe cadet until 12 months from line check , 2 stripes next 4 years then 3 stripes . Cpt at 8-10 years .

[2019-06-04 11:04:24] <iglehane> I’d say it’s all for show. Not many 3 stripes around over the last few years. Are they trying to make the operation look more like the competitors? Anyway hours alone isn’t a good judge of ability. I fly with someone a few times before letting them try max anything. That applies to everyone. 
[2019-06-04 12:59:04] <coolhand787> Correct just like Declan Ryan is now <mailto:ryand1@ryanair.com|ryand1@ryanair.com> (edited)
[2019-06-04 13:02:42] <coolhand787> Correct Ian the number of hours is not always an indication to the skill level. However here I still consider the 3 stripe action a way to show public that RYR have ‘experienced’ FOs. Like I previously posed it’s all show! Since pay does not take into account the number of stripes...

[2019-06-05 15:42:42] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FJYPBG6D9 with text: It was around 07:30 in the morning of the 23rd of August, 2018. The long days of mediation had finally ended, our signatures were still wet on the paper after a final 22hrs of very difficult negotiations, but the deal was done. 

A man at the highest Pilot rank that one can attain reached across the table, as did I, he shook my hand firmly and looked me straight in the eye as is his way, tired and battered as we were we both knew his words were true. “This will be good, this will be good for Pilots, this will be good for the airline, we can work with this”.

We had achieved a fair and transparent seniority system, we had reached a recognition agreement between IALPA/Fórsa and Ryanair, we had set out the rules of engagement for future engagements, but the trump card was this. 3rd party mediation was now the template that replaced the primitive  ‘take it or leave it’ policies that had done so much harm to the pilots and other staff, and which had also done so much harm to the airline itself. 

The formula for change and for success for all parties had been put in place by the sweat and tears of a determined minority of pilots and their families who risked everything they had owned or built to do it, but now no one would have to risk everything again, they would just have to use this formula now in place. Pilots would simply have to turn up and turn the wheels of the machine for it to work. 

We wear yellow lanyards, full uniform for our profession, we are respectful and professional to our managers, we are no longer viewed as the militant minority, rather we are ‘how it works now’. We have a recognition agreement, Ryanair has recognised us as the means of communicating with its people. Now it’s long past time for those remaining pilots who think this work is someone else’s problem to recognise this fact, this change, just as Ryanair management have already done. 

We don’t have time for the ball and chain of pilots who think “I’ll just keep the head down”. The quicker we are unified, the quicker the uncertainty will pass, the quicker our lives will improve, and the elegance in this solution is that behind that will come a return to profit for the company like it has never known before.

The first in to the fight for change have already lead the change, the only people to have lost their jobs in this were Council members, all council members accepted that risk in the belief that others would follow, and follow they did. Of all those that followed their council, none lost their jobs, promotions continued, and the new norm of a Unionised Ryanair settled in. 

In this context we still have those other Pilots who have not yet moved towards the agreed solution. Everybody understands that Contractors can not take industrial action because they have no rights. Everybody knows that those on probation cannot take industrial action either. That does not mean that either category cannot be involved. There are no end of safe opportunities to channel your support, and do so safely. Just ask your council, we have work to do. Lots and lots of it.

Then we have those employees who look away. I can’t get involved because xyz. Trust me on one thing, there is not one Pilot at any level of this movement who did not have as good a reason as any other not to get involved. We all have a reason not to, so on that basis, by virtue of what has already been done, there simply is no reason.

[2019-06-05 15:42:42] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FJYPBG6D9 with text: I was treated with respect by my Base Captain throughout my term as Chairman, I got no intimidation from him whatsoever while I lead 5 strikes for change. 22 LTC’s walked in the front door of HQ recently in yellow lanyards and received not one negative comment. It is absolutely nonsensical at this stage to fear the company noticing your association with your Pilots association. To be unable to wear the yellow Lanyard because (insert any excuse you can find here - we all have them too) and be unable to say with all honesty and respect that “I am wearing this because I am proud to fly this plane and I want to help make this Airline a place people will stay” is something I cannot comprehend in 2019. 

There is only space left at the back of our army, the notion that it is dangerous back there while all of those up front are still here, still getting base transfers, still getting promoted, is an idea that has - to coin a phrase - no basis in reality. 

I’m afraid it may be much too late to explain to me why it might be too dangerous for any one to wear the yellow lanyard, if you can explain it to yourself you have apparently missed out on a change that has already happened. If for your own reasons you actually disagree with Union activity then that’s your choice, I won’t ask you to wear the company colour around your neck like we do. If you do agree, do wear it. 

The change is here. Join in.

It’s 27 years ago now, at Sea they used to say of Engineers and deck officers that Oil and water don’t mix, but I’ll tell you this, when you’re engine only gets you half way to the port of Rotterdam and you sit there dead ship in storm alley, there’s no oil and water.

We were all below, all hands of any rank in minors caps and lamps, pick axes and shovels digging half burned tar out of the stove hot scavenge spaces. Rows of 40 gallons drums of tar put there by a whole crew, not half of it. 

Of 8 cylinders we made port with 5 still running, 3 of which had one day’s life left, a ship won’t get home on two legs. 
All 8 had to be replaced. 

The M.V Endeavour was on a flag of convenience, I blew a hole in the deck with a fire hose once, and she was not done with us either. During repairs she went on fire. 

We fought that as a whole crew too, not half of us feet up and half of us in the fight. 

You know where I’m going with this don’t you? The other half need to stand up and be a part of the fight too. Those flags of convenience come for all of us, not half of us. We are all in the same bloody boat. 

People need to get that, you need to tell them, ‘you’ being all of us in here. :bee:

[2019-06-07 09:31:33] <tomflood737> As Robin correctly states, there’s absolutely no reason to fear being recognised as being a potential member or actual member of our association. It is after all our democratic right. 

In the real world, fear can only succeed on an interim basis, that interim period is now over for Ryanair Pilots. It’s time for all to make the transition. 

Just like the “perceived time pressures” there will inevitably be perceived fear pressure, but neither should be perceived. 

This is the time to show your individuality for the betterment of Unity. You are after all your association/union. 

I, as an individual choose to wear the Yellow Lanyard of Unity. I do so in the belief that a unified pilot body will function with increased efficiently, safely and with longevity. 

Why lurk in the shadow of fear when you have the opportunity to hold your head high in the glory of Unity.

[2019-06-07 11:36:35] <kilroyrobin> Absolutely true, “the Union didn’t fix anything for me so I gave up on the Union” is technically the identical statement to saying ‘We didn’t fix anything because the members gave up’. In equal measure the Unions victory is actually the members victory. Every thing we have won is ours.  
[2019-06-07 12:45:31] <tuhhodge> Does this make the French contracts even less desirable?

[2019-06-09 17:28:06] <kilroyrobin> I have no doubt it well represent more division for us to contend with, but strike under any one nation is already virtually useless, FR has turned around only twice, Christmas 17, (4 countries), August 18, (5 countries) this is of course except for countries of the magnitude of the U.K. or Italy, both of which would be big enough to go it alone easily. This fight will always be a transnational challenge. Their answer will always be divide and conquer, ours will always be multiply and conquer. It is more important in my view that we focus on maintaining a unified and motivated Pilot Body rather than focusing on issues over which we have little control. Our enemy is not really in HQ, it is in our own side. Pilot Apathy. If we had 99% pilot engagement not one of these issues would be of any concern. If we even had 50% the future would be in the bag for us here.

In the end it took 38 days to break through to re-supply Halley Base, Antarctica. The red BAS Twin Otter flying by completed an ice obs, dropped a bag of Christmas mail and was about to return to base when this photo was taken. On the starboard bridge wing the camera picks out a man standing on the azimuth platform for the view, he just made up his mind about flying. The man is me. 

18 years later I stumbled across this photo online by pure chance, and there it is, one of my favourite moments. A moment of absolute determination.

Half the people who learn to fly never finish, those of us who made it through got here because we had a dream that drove us through by grit and determination. But this is a dream that has been prayed upon by the bean counter for much too long. 

The vultures have been pulling at the debt ridden youngsters who’s dream it was to come here and be the best they could be for far too long. They are not a commodity though, or an aircraft part, they are the future of our profession. Our young colleague in the right seat today earns under half what I earned for the same job. Why? Because collectively we let it happen. 

The pay in our profession was halved not because management were stealing it, but because a lack of pilot Unity surrendered it. 

I have a dream, you have a dream, we all got here on a dream of bettering ourselves, so why the hell would we ever stop looking up and wondering that same old question...’could I do that?’. That’s the stuff we are made of - or else we would not be here. 

Never forget what you have already achieved, or else someone might just convince you to forget what we must still achieve. 

Where were you when you got the flying bug? where were you when you started what we have yet to finish?

[2019-06-10 21:06:17] <noelintogher> I was at the controls of a Cessna150 on a 30 minute experience flight bought as a present by my wife. First time flying I thought, I like this. I might be good at this. I started a little older than most others. Some people thought at 35 I might be a little late starting to train as a professional pilot. I thought, I should have done this earlier but better late than never. I have to make this work, see where it brings me. It brought me right where I want to be. 
Same as now, we should have unified and stood up for ourselves years earlier. But hey, better late than never. United we stand, see where it can bring us!

[2019-06-10 21:23:46] <robwatts99> Two similar life moments sparked my love for flight. Both of them sitting as a child on the old airport road with my dad. One of them watching the aer lingus 747 departing. The size, the noise. Watching it roll down the runway and out of sight only to pop up from behind the bushes. The other watching concord arriving. What a spectacle. Certainly left an imprint on a young mind. Ever since flight has fascinated me. I could sit and watch birds fly all day. Had my first lesson as a 16th birthday present. Never thought it could be a career though until I saw flight schools advertising when I was mid 20s and that's where my journey to be the FO robin mentions above. In love with flight, highly in debt and so desperate for a job I'd have signed anything :pensive: all got me to where I am now though. Let's hope we can help change it for future generations of pilot.

[2019-06-11 19:51:38] <kilroyrobin> One of the interesting things is the different paint schemes the different AOC’s have, like FR but not really. When the Amoco Cadiz (on a Liberian flag of convenience) spilled 1.6million barrels of crude on to the Brittany coast in 1978 it suddenly became obvious that it was a bad idea to have ‘Amoco’ emblazoned on the funnel as it stuck out of the swill. Suddenly tankers stopped writing a brand they valued on the funnel.  In the age of the flag of convenience where standards might slip, but costs could be slashed, this was all very clever indeed.

[2019-06-12 09:20:44] <iunius.masset> But why pay the high German tax when we could pay Maltese tax instead which is very low?! German DBA (bi-lateral tax agreement between Germany and Malta) would allow that. (edited)

We know how long it takes to become a pilot, and it takes longer still to really think like a pilot, possibly it will take as long as it takes for you to make a few serious mistakes in your efforts to elude old Murphy and his predatory little law. But what I’m not sure about is exactly how long it takes a person to reverse the metamorphosis and stop being a pilot. The industry is not short of flyers who fold up their wings and scuttle back into the silky cocoon to crawl off as a flightless caterpillar and munch out their days on green backs, so how long must you fly a desk before you actually loose that hard earned line pilot perspective only to be dissolved into a walking abacus. 1 year, 5 years? 10years? What is the timeline that allows one to refer to potentially lethal events as ‘statistical outliers’, instead of thinking of these spreadsheet digits in the more pilot minded terms of ‘souls onboard’.

That’s why a new captain in FR has a 20% chance of an incident in their first 12 months in the left seat. Then after that (4yrs FO &amp; 1 year in Command Murphy has them trained). Then by contrast 5 years picking your favourite roster and crew for your 2 sector flight once a month, not to mention picking your crew and favourite TRE every 6 months for the Sim and then by that stage Murphy looses his grip on that pilot for the most part. That is to say he or she no longer has to think like a line pilot and can happily clunk the beads around that abacus with relative impunity.

[2019-06-13 09:33:21] <boswellbrown> I believe the German tax office and courts have already taken a view on this. Local employment, local taxes and from our perspective, very importantly, local rights and protections. Not the sham we had in the past. Low taxes are not always a win, win. ... there’s a catch! How many German crew paid a price? 
[2019-06-13 09:46:10] <boswellbrown> I’ve said it before.. Ray abrogated his real duties quite some years ago.  
[2019-06-13 11:03:15] <damiano.detomassi> Well yes and no, German Finanzamt won’t take the taxes from Ryanair DAC for us . All they wanted was social security . (edited)
[2019-06-13 11:20:14] <andy.airamerica> The day he sat on the opposite side of the negotiating table was the day he chose the wrong side.  
[2019-06-13 16:45:08] <kilroyrobin> Of course my comments above are generic, however in reference to our Chief Pilot it is my opinion that he was the first on that side of the table to appreciate the complete and utter reasonableness of our demands made on behalf of the members (as described in our 11points ). Once the mediator finally insisted that FR had to actually listen to us before they could dismiss us it was obvious that what he had been told so far (the no basis in reality bla bla they can’t even tell us what they want BS) was revealed to him as being un true. Remember until that meeting not one attempt was ever made at any time during IRCC meetings to even listen through to our explanations of the points listed on the ballot paper. They were still in ‘take or leave it’ mode until they were forced from it. Despite some of the issues that those present will never forget, I don’t doubt that in this sense his presence and ability to simply hear what was being said instead of attacking outright like the others was helpful. I still can’t understand however why anybody who wears the uniform would ever sit over there and negotiate against their own. It’s not a unique situation to Ryanair of course, but it’s a complete perversion of a normal leadership ethos to me, to me you lead those on your side by supporting them. We will get where we are going though, now that we have started it would be daft not to.

[2019-06-13 17:17:48] <ginosabatino> Christ they are getting worse.

Todays wannabe managers are advocating 

timing from enging start to taxi (how about not attempting to rush the pack configuration and flaps..)

Time from airborne to flaps up...really? Shall we start the clean up immediately after gear up? Or perhaps when the nosewheel lifts...

% departure with minimum fuel...yes, lets tell then Fueller to the absolute kilo what we want. Not a drop more....

Can we have an enmass response to these fuel comments.....!

 
[2019-06-13 17:54:10] <grahamkendall13> Hi can anyone point me to where the rule is written/ memo about no one allowed in the flightdeck if there are free seats in the cabin in UK airpspace? Thanks! 
[2019-06-13 18:31:22] <fergus.cassidy> Never seen that one. That may be only UK based crews although it should affect all flights either landing or departing UK airports.

[2019-06-13 18:59:23] <fergus.cassidy> Sorry, for staff travel, its pax seats first, then cabin jumpseats, then flight deck but that's all airspace. Not just UK. For flight deck no restriction about uk airspace for duty travel. A passenger can travel in the flight deck with permission of the chief pilot. But they must disembark in a UK airport with the passengers, they can't travel back to the airport they left without first clearing immigration and security. 
[2019-06-13 19:07:33] <gmulcair99> There was something (memo/fci)  about flights into the UK ..... jumpseaters only allowed in flight-deck if there were no seats in the cabin .... can’t remember where or when  I saw it. Think Note 4 above refers to that. 
[2019-06-13 19:14:02] <alex.was.oconnell> I’m lost for words at some of the replies, I don’t normally open that fleet tweet app but this thread led me to.

[2019-06-13 19:26:43] <kilroyrobin> I agree with that Ger, there was something about that.  
[2019-06-13 19:43:55] <jorgelucca> There was a Memo some time ago. It was prohibited to occupy a Flight Deck jumpseat operating out or into the UK for security reasons. I cannot find it. The only thing I found was in the Ops Man A page 8-302. "operations has the list of states whose state security policy permits authorised persons to occupy a flight deck jumpseat only when there is no seat available in the cabin". (edited)
[2019-06-13 19:52:35] <jamiekerr513> I have someone who is doing his 737 rating soon. They were asking about technical books to supplement the manuals provided by Ryanair for 737. I suggested maybe cockpit companion but does anyone have any other good books out there they would recommend? 
[2019-06-13 19:55:44] <spac> Don't over complicate the issue. Cockpit Companion is fine, but I'd suggest after the rating is complete. Only my opinion, though! (edited)
[2019-06-13 19:56:22] <padawa> This seems a fairly decent book

[2019-06-13 19:58:32] <hrvojesucic> For general understanding of the systems I would recommend the pdf book made by Bert DeJong (ground school instructor in CAE Amsterdam). It’s called “Boeing 737NG Systems”. It is unofficial (as is Cockpit Companion), but it clarifies the systems in a brilliant way, a lot better than CC does. The FCOM is of course the primary source. (Edit: CC is a lot more detailed.) (edited)
[2019-06-13 20:00:54] <kilroyrobin> I agree with jan. just stick to the manuals and pass. Go in more depth later, but there’s more than most people can manage in the manuals alone. That’s how I see it, once you pass the more in-depth publications are a great way to refocus and revisit things to stay sharp.  
[2019-06-13 20:02:50] <jamiekerr513> Absolutely agree with the above. Just asking as a messenger :+1: cheers for the input (edited)
[2019-06-13 20:09:32] <robertgormley53> Yeh there was a memo just before I first joined, so 2015. It said we could only travel on the jumpseat, in and out of UK airports 'for operational reasons' due to a UK home office rule. So line checks etc 
[2019-06-13 20:54:14] <fergus.cassidy> That memo probably is regarding coming in and out of the  country in the jump seat. We do a lot of ATC observations flight out of SNN and it is in relation to through flights whether that is back to airport or departure or a new airport. They have to go in with the passengers and clear custom and then recheck in again for the next flight. We can have jumpseats returning to SNN to Spain, Portugal, Poland, Germany etc. Only the UK won't allow it. 
[2019-06-13 20:55:17] <hrvojesucic> Anyone knows why queries for base captains go through Diarmuid Rogers? 
[2019-06-13 20:58:35] <fergus.cassidy> Control. To make sure base captain's aren't making any false promises. 
	:point_up: robertwasilewski
[2019-06-13 20:58:35] <brendanjacobs> Can you elaborate on the subject of the query? 
[2019-06-13 21:20:10] <hrvojesucic> Query was related to changing base. Parking and ID. Why? 
[2019-06-13 21:27:43] <fergus.cassidy> Changing base would be under Diarmuid Rogers. Parking and ID would be different departments. 
[2019-06-13 21:31:58] <howard.denis> I sent a query to BC about renewing my ID he said he never got it so had to email him directly! Waste of time that system! 
[2019-06-13 21:35:52] <hrvojesucic> I know that I’m going to a new base, so DR is not required. BC is the person you normally need to talk to if you are applying for an ID. Denis, I was thinking the same. But it’s interesting BCs aren’t getting queries directly, DR is probably acting as a filter. 
[2019-06-13 21:47:59] <coolhand787> I agree with above, therwise it is info overload for new recruits which could end up taking way their attention from essential learning provided in RYR Manuals/CBT. Bill Bulfer’s book is great but later  
[2019-06-13 21:49:49] <coolhand787> I agree with Fergus it’s all about control over each topics to ensure BC’s are following company guidelines. No slacking of rules... (edited)
[2019-06-13 21:52:19] <brendanjacobs> Reports from Crew Control, for example no shows etc, used to first go to the BC. That has changed since union recognition. Perhaps the same here

[2019-06-14 06:56:53] <derekfdoyle> I queried the SNN BC about car parking for an OOB. DR replied.

[2019-06-14 07:40:38] <pilot> Agree as well with all above. Don’t ask too many questions in first instance,go into depth later!

[2019-06-14 08:25:04] <damiano.detomassi> Since local law any HR function was removed from the BC (at least in Germany ) . This was clearly stated . BC is there for safety only . This is to avoid the case in which there is someone HR in the country the union or employee can sue/attack/ refer to .  
[2019-06-14 10:47:35] <masterharkin> Is there industrial action in Glasgow international this morning? My Sister was to take a flight from GLA-DUB this morning. She checked in as normal late last night and got her boarding card no issue then she gets notified late last night that her early morning flight will now depart from PIK instead due to I.A. Obviously she can’t get Ryanair on the phone so has no clue what to do. She decides this morning to risk it and starts driving to PIK at 4am. Gets the flight but her car is now in PIK and Ryanair have her return flight landing in GLA. Who gets her car? Who pays for all the out of pocket expenses? AGB!! 
[2019-06-14 10:49:25] <philip.ardagh> There was a security strike this day last week Steve. Caused major delays. I was on the afternoon GLA and and there were 10 crew working on the turnaround to get us out on time. 
[2019-06-14 10:56:53] <coolhand787> That makes sense Damiano  
[2019-06-14 10:59:26] <brendanjacobs> That flight was changed to PIK before I reported for duty yesterday morning. Why they waited until late last night to inform the pax, I don’t know! 
[2019-06-14 12:20:53] <ryan665> I did the flight Steve, flight changed to PIK yesterday on the IDP, there was industrial action until 9am local today, ops told me pax where making there own way from GLA to PIK.  
[2019-06-14 17:40:22] <bkehoe00> PIK airport were announcing yesterday (from around 1400z) that the flight would operate to PIK on all their social media accounts. Industrial action is ongoing in GLA and ABZ for the last few weeks. The airport are saying ‘no impact’ on their social media accounts yet there’s been no fire cover for several hours some days (and thus zero movements and slots to delay arrivals) and just minimal security staff on duty at peak times resulting in huge delays. Another example of employer sticking their head in the sand. (edited)

*Consolidation* and *Unity* are effectively the same thing. 

As pilots we need to Unite,  we need to consolidate. 

This is an international airline but I will always be proud of the fact that this is an Irish airline. 

The majority of Dublin pilots wear the color of *Unity* - time to make it international also.

But not at any cost

As professionals we strive to be the best we can be. 
We strive to provide a safe and pleasant working environment 
We strive to provide a pleasant experience and safe conveyance for millions of human beings every year.

But we can only do that when we are supported by a management team that are as strong with the “human touch” as they are with an Excel(lent) spreadsheet.

Dignity, respect, politeness, manners.

Basic concepts
But I’d wager-that if we were valued, if we were respected, if we were treated as an asset of and for the company-the vast majority of us would gladly fall over ourselves to help the bottom line in the name of efficiency and safety. Be it fuel burn, printer paper, whatever KPI measure....

Unity before flight

But just the pilots 
Not just the pilots and the rest of the crew, ground staff, engineers etc

Management need to be on board the unity train

Then there would be a truly unstoppable force in aviation
The Pride of Ireland (besides the occasional rugby match) 

An old boy often said to me as an FO when discussing the social occasions of previous days off “the worst thing about this job is telling people you work for FR”

I hope one day we can all stand shoulder to shoulder as front line staff and management, and step forward together, take on the world, and win.

Never forget what we all are together, even as a massive minority we hammered through a tectonic change and that was simply because we found our strength together. Happy Father’s Day one and all, happy Mother’s Day as well, who cares the date, our celebration is now permanent, it’s every now and then, and anytime, and any day, it’s every day.

I hope that 2019 will bring even more people home past those long and winding roads of excuses or manufactured reasons that we all sell ourselves for a while before we return to ourselves. When you get past all that then you’re home in more ways than a postcode could ever find.

[2019-06-17 17:11:30] <andy.airamerica> If they keep squeezing higher productivity out of the same amount of people they don’t need to hire more staff because the job still gets done. Productivity has its downsides.  
[2019-06-17 18:35:44] <t_mc_c> Guys what’s the situation with Ryanair staff sitting in flight deck. I got an email today from someone in flight planning asking if it was possible to sit in flight deck when he is standby travel on one of my flights. I know there was a memo about this. In my mind he can only sit in flight deck if all other seats are full, is this correct?  
[2019-06-17 18:52:30] <kilroyrobin> He should be able to get authorisation from Ray Conway.

[2019-06-17 18:54:06] <andy.airamerica> OPS A 8.3.13.1 bullet point 7.  As long as the person has a Ryanair DAC or Ryanair Sun Identification they can occupy a flightdeck jumpseat. However, Number 4 on the next page will apply to wherever you are going. 
[2019-06-17 18:59:30] <t_mc_c> Thanks guys, 
I see there is a note on that stating that they can only use jumpseat if no seats in the cabin... so that seems to answer my question. Flight is tomorrow so I doubt he’ll have letter from ray.  
[2019-06-17 19:00:54] <fergus.cassidy> If there's  a letter no issue other than you allowing it. Just check ID against letter. 
[2019-06-17 19:02:19] <t_mc_c> Pretty sure he won’t have one, so from what I’ve read I’ll have to say no unless cabin is full. Again thanks guys for the info.  
[2019-06-17 19:06:16] <fergus.cassidy> Slack always provides. The Oracle of knowledge. 
[2019-06-17 19:17:50] <gmulcair99> Once he has Ryanair ID he can sit in the flight deck - have had about 3 or 4 from HQ on the flight deck jumpseat with no problems before.

In one case I received an email requesting it with the persons name the previous day.
In the other cases cabin was full.
Can’t do it going into the UK unless no seats in the cabin. 
Only time I had a letter authorising non Ryanair person to sit on flight deck jumpseat was for non Ryanair employee who was contracting for Ryanair ( non flying staff) and only if there was no seat in the cabin 
[2019-06-17 19:22:24] <philip.ardagh> ID and standby is fine. No harm in accommodating these guys Tom. I helped a guy from ops young neice last summer when it looked like she was stranded and he still gets on the phone to thank me if he hears it's me calling ops with a problem. 
[2019-06-17 19:37:39] <paulkgriffin> I had the same Tom. Some random lad from HQ emailed me asking permission to sit up front.
I forgot about the email and come the day in question I didn't hear a peep from him.
I've no issue taking staff when it's full but this wasn't the case. He just wanted to sit in the jumpseat.
It's up to you in this case. If it was someone from Rostering then I'd happily accommodate. :smile:

[2019-06-18 06:56:05] <jessica.emurphy2009> I’m on stby earlies today at 5.30am local got two calls yesterday one at 8pm trying to tell me they wanted to put me on a MUC with a 5.10am report. Obviously I didn’t answer as it was during my rest period. This is still continuing calling during rest with no text for idp notification which is supposed to be the less intrusive method that they thought up. They still can’t make up their minds about how to do this:face_with_rolling_eyes: 
[2019-06-18 08:18:36] <andy.airamerica> Unfortunately Jessica a phonecall is not seen as a disruption to your rest but a way for the company to inform the pilot of a duty at the earliest possible opportunity in order to facilitate adequate rest. Questionable logic there I know.  
[2019-06-18 08:34:00] <boswellbrown> We need those newspaper stand / holders and put them outside security at STN :grin: 
[2019-06-18 11:07:20] <oliver> Thank you very much for your support.

Now we also need RTPG to formally recognize UIL in Italy, without support its getting very difficult to steer things in the right direction.

New pilots are either not told about UIL’s choice of reppresentation or simply sent to Anpac if they get based in Italy. I understand the difficulty in new pilots joining, if they think we are not recognized, yes, even the judge understood this and ordered RYR to invite us at the negotiation table.

I hope RTPG will grant us the courtesy to have a UIL CC system approved for Italy...... and we will play by the rule for the common “good”. (edited)
[2019-06-18 13:09:07] <kilroyrobin> I’M A PROFESSIONAL PILOT:- Great, join the Union and look after your profession.

I’M A HUMAN PILOT:- Great, you may one day make a mistake, you need to be in an a IFALPA Union so that you will receive the protection you need.

I’M A SELFISH PILOT:- Great, join the Union, together we will achieve more for yourself (and others, not that this would matter of coarse).

I’M A GREEDY PILOT:- Great, Join the Union, get everyone around you to join up aswell and you will get a fairer share of the company’s substantial profit.

I’M A PILOT THAT WANTS THE COMPANY TO DO WELL: Great, Join the Union, a two way conversation works better in making the right decisions in the Flight deck, we need that at management level too. Better decisions and two way communications are much better for the Company than “take it or leave it"  turned out to be.

I’M A PILOT WHO IS LEAVING:- Great, Join the Union, do your bit to fix European aviation during your unique opportunity as a Pilot in Europes biggest and therefore most defining airline which will ultimately set your terms and conditions anywhere in Europe. You can run but you cannot hide.

I’M A PILOT WITH A FAMILY:- Great, join the Union, they want you to stay here on a 5:4 roster not scamper off to China, make the small changes that will keep you here at home, and then stay at home.

I’M A PILOT WITH DEBT:- Great, join the Union, with better terms and conditions you will pay that off quicker, just like all the others who also have debt (which is damn near everyone).

I’M A FEARFUL PILOT:- Great, join the Union and then you will only have half as many sides to be afraid of, we are safer together. Join up, safety in numbers.

I’M A MANAGEMENT PILOT:- Great, join the Union, you would be surprised how senior some of our members are, you would also be surprised how many of the more long sighted managers have already realised the turn in the tide is here, they already show this to Union reps by engaging with respect. An upwardly mobile manager is not part of the past, they are part of the future, go ahead, take us there.

I’M A LAZY PILOT:- Great, join the Union, we need to make life easier here, lazy people in particular are getting a tough time around here.

I’M A YOUNG PILOT:- Great, join the Union, you have more to gain by saving this career than the older hands.

I’M A PILOT WITH A BAD EXPERIENCE OF UNIONS:- Great, join the Union, the members are the Union and they run the Union. Get involved, supporting the Union fixes the Union. A bad Union experience is caused by a bad Unity experience.

I’M A PILOT AT THE END OF MY CAREER:- Great, join the Union, a legacy carrier might not have been yours, but we all think about legacy as we finish up. Finish up in style.

I’M A CRAP PILOT:- Great, join the Union. All the others are Crap too, it just depends on which short moment within the 20 or 30 thousand hours they might accumulate which they ultimately end up being defined by. When you get it wrong in a fraction of a second, all the other hours are irrelevant to the judge. The question is only this, who defends you at the bench?

NO YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND, I REALLY AM CRAP:- Err, OK, Join the Union, you need unity more than anyone. Get in quick!

I’M A CLEVER PILOT:- Great, you won’t need all this explained. (edited)

[2019-06-18 13:52:11] <robertgormley53> Great Post Robin. I think one issue that could be holding back some from wearing yellow lanyards is: "I'm a pilot who is right of centre in terms of ideology and don't believe in unions'. My answer to that would be, Aviation is unlike most other industries. Its not as straightforward to leave and go across the road to work in JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsch Bank etc. If you need to stay in Ryanair and want to help fix the problems, only a Union can do it.

[2019-06-19 08:08:16] <timkuijpers> Yesterday many of us (probably everybody) in CGN received a notification from crewcontrol containing a CONVQ which apparently stands for an e-learning OCC. The days after then either changed to stand-by or flight duties on a B73Q instead of B738... :thinking_face: Also flying single trip outbound, and deadhead back on a 9Q aircraft.. So the scedule is really there to get 9Q aircraft in CGN and we are expexted to just go with it.

This 'funny' short notice notification would result in a from our side irreversible change of operator without any signatures or contracts. All to happen within 2 days! As a result nobody here knows what to do. And thanks to ryanair time is not on our side (or is it...) 

For cabin crew there is already an e-learning, but for flightcrew not yet. And the basecaptain tells us (via unofficial means) that we won't be flying 9Q aircraft untill there is something signed by both parties. 

It is a big coincidence that yesterday, the day hell broke loose here in CGN, Declan Ryan would be in CGN the whole day for 'no particular reason'. We were told he couldn't make it due to some negotiations with VC. Is at least the latter part true? 

Any other bases experiencing the same? It seems to me like the standard Ryanair strategy and only some proper Unity will teach them.

[2019-06-19 10:50:02] <arnaud2cagny> I keep hearing people having "force majeure" situation but unaware or unsure of how to proceed, so here is a summary: 1) notify FR on IDP absence reason"force majeure situation" 2) before your first duty back at work send an email to <mailto:dubcrew@ryanair.com|dubcrew@ryanair.com> with a) self certifate with "force majeure leave"(advise <mailto:dubcrew@ryanair.com|dubcrew@ryanair.com> if self cert not available) and b) any "force majeure leave form" you find on Google,
Some forms are misleading (IE you request the leave, but really you take it and request it to be applied) 
Note you must be on a permanent contract and out of probation, no medical cert shall be supplied nor requested, 1 day is fine more in a row see guidance above from SIPTU it is subject to the emergency, you are entitled 3 days in one year and 5 within 3 years. The situation could arise at any moment so you are protected from unfair dismissal as per the parental act see the act for more details. Finally the leave is paid so no loss of basic nor loss of annual leave (edited)

On a day that has been significant through all time for driving the change of seasons, the old for the new, I call for us here to use the longest day of the year to remember those at the senior level of our Union drive for change. They are fighting to make things change right now. These people are those who will change the old for the new.

There are Chairmen and others right across the network today throwing all their free time into this, followed by buckets of energy so much so that it is by now impossible to believe they still have got more to give, but their strength is not only from them - it is from you.

Enda Ryan, Chairman of the BALPA company council but also President of the Ryanair Transnational Pilot Group, Arpad Heger the Chairman of the VC company council, to name but two of many, both men there from the very start of all of this. Hundreds of meetings, hundreds of letters, hundreds of days hour upon hour, and by now year upon year. For them the longest days are still ahead. We are talking about a long long time at max continuous thrust for them.

If their strength comes from you, then remember it today, and show it tomorrow, show every day. Yellow lanyards in every crew room folks! show that you know their strength comes from you, it comes from all of us, but we need to show it. They might burn the torch for us but we must bring the fuel. (edited)

Watching my son whistle through the graffiti confusion of a skatepark wall the clarity in my mind is there as strong as ever. There’s never a day I don’t think about how much we risked last year, both in my home, and in the home of hundreds of others. Where would I be now if they had sacked me, where would we all be now if we had not stuck together against an ultimate industrial adversary. What if fear had got to our members before self respect and brotherhood took hold for good. The only thing that appalls me more than this is the thought of how much worse it all would be now if we had never taken our chances and held our stance. We would all be leaving anyway by now. The manipulative ‘matrix of criteria’, the hostels, the disciplinary sanction on base transfers, the crew room floors and a never ending ‘take it or leave it’ management style would have seen to that quicker than ever before. In the end what we did in 2018 was far closer to saving our jobs than gambling our jobs. My endless respect and eternal thanks to my marching brothers and sisters. You saved my job I don’t doubt, and all of our jobs besides no doubt, who after all would have stayed for the hostels, who would have gone to Poland either. There was only ever one answer. The only way to stay was always to fight. It still is.

The lengths this company goes to to avoid losing control is extraordinary!! They apparently have nothing left in the pot when it comes to our negotiations but seems there’s a bottomless pot when it comes to union busting!! Goes a long way to show this is not about the cost involved at all but purely driven by the obsession of retaining control!

[2019-06-23 16:52:58] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FKTL64H6Z with text: “I DON’T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO STRIKE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE” - Well, I totally agree, so the question becomes why can we not achieve this? Why have negotiations repeatedly disintegrated into “that will never happen, it’s impossible, that’s a red line issue, that’s a legacy procedure, that can’t work in a low cost model..” only for it to suddenly become workable after the inevitable strike. 

Over the great descent through the floor of our original terms and conditions we heard again and again “take it or leave it”. Even after union recognition, the purpose of which is to negotiations (not strike), we were still being told “take it or leave it”. There were only two occasions where substantial changes were brought about:- 

(1) when 4 countries threatened strike action (and Germany completed this action) in December 2017

(2) when 5 countries took strike action in August 2018. 

For much of the remaining time we have endured the finest quality of Union busting strategies, delaying tactics, divide and conquer, insistence on negotiations at local level rather than across the whole airline as you might find elsewhere, frequent misrepresentations of the Unions position such as when the 11 points on the Irish Ballot were subtly but fundamentally edited, and then the edited version was intentionally circulated to a wide audience to misrepresent the Union position. Other tactics included distracting the conversation publicly with false claims and statements such as the famous 200 grand salary we were publicly stated as earning while we actually sought a zero cost seniority agreement. (Zero cost that is unless there is money to be had in the absence of fairness and transparency which our system was intended to bring)

So the question of why it is that we have to strike in order to negotiate effectively is a very good question indeed, somebody should ask senior management why they insist on this disruptive strategy, It is absolutely beyond me why it must be this way, but until either we decide we will accept ‘take it or leave it’ negotiations again, or they decide to bring an end to this ineffective futile and dysfunctional position we have no choice but to do this the roundabout way. 

The failure of this impetuous lopsided and bull headed gravy train policy is now totally proven to be a failure. The halving of our share price is the proof, but where is the breaking point if half is not enough, a third? A quarter? How obsessed with its survival is it’s instigator, and why? So many questions but only one answer. 

The fair and reasonable statement that “I DON’T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO STRIKE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE” should of course be true, but it has nearly 2 decades of categoric proof that it is not. This is indicated by the catastrophic fall in terms and conditions which culminated in the crew shortage crisis and flight cancellations for our passengers in 2017 and some would say right through 2018, as well as a widespread and ongoing failure at management level to adapt to the change that the situation now clearly demands. 

You can take it as fact that all council members cannot wait for the day when the above statement on negotiating rather than striking becomes true. However the day that happens is not up to us as Pilots, making sure it happens is the bit that is up to us. All of us. 

One quick and unequivocal equation to finish, the more Pilots bring the change, the shorter will be the fight and the sooner we can get back to growing and consolidating what we have all helped to build in this Airline.

[2019-06-25 08:55:39] <kilroyrobin> IT’S AN IRONY, BUT I FIND THE DISASTER OF THE MAX HAS HELPED EXPLAIN OUR FIGHT FOR UNITY.

Previously when people would ask me what motivated me to get active in the Unions I would state that Pilots need to have a collective voice or they are ignored by the higher decision makers in aviation, and this in turn narrows our hard earned safety margins.

There was often an innocence in the response, the blank face that would ask the same question as all the others… “but sure they can’t just do that? but they can’t just say that surely? but aviation is so safe? but surely the regulators would never allow that? but but but.? They were sold an invincible dream, but I was trying to tell them of a fallible reality.

Since the Max tragedy I can now just say that having a collective voice is a fundamental professional responsibility for Pilots. It is repeatedly demonstrated that only accountants AND Pilots who work together can walk the tightrope. In open communication together they can hold that balanced line between great profit and terrible loss, but the the bloody facts of History are that in autocracy they will fail again and again.

When the blank face begins to question my point, I just say look at Boeing, look at the Max, look at what a management that surrenders itself entirely to share price rule really can bring. Suddenly they understand that all the other barriers cannot always beat the share price greenback god of the bean counter. Maybe all the other barriers together can, but ours is and must be one of those.

The bean counter must do his part, but we must do ours in the balancing act of flight. We must communicate our view as a collective body of professionals. If we don’t the Max tragedy happens. At no point in history was it every any different, this is just our little part of History. We have to make sure we can stand over it because the rules of play are the same as ever.

Success in our profession is the safe and ever enjoyable cloud surfing at dawn, the views from our window on the beautiful world beneath, the landings we love, the camaraderie and the poetry in motion and control of such a beautiful machine, but the failure is tragedy. There’s no point in ever forgetting that dark angel of the other shoulder.

Together we walk the line.

[2019-06-26 08:37:06] <kilroyrobin> As the wave of yellow lanyards, or Union membership in any colour, makes its march across a crew room there must naturally be a divide that some will feel bear down on them. Due to the individual differences and pressures in each of our lives, some may feel that it bears down on them alone, but this is untrue. 

This is the fence of fear, or at least that is what you call it until you climb it, after which you often can’t seem to see it any more at all. 

This fence of fear is a fabrication of a divide and conquer management ethic, as such it is a symbol of our past. It is not brought to you by the wave of Unity or by the Union, rather it was put here to prevent this. In the end all of us moving to one side - the Pilots side - is the symbol of our future. 

There must in any sweeping change unfortunately be those who do perceive that approaching front as if it leans on them in some special way for some special reason, even though virtually everyone has these same ways and reasons. 

The amount of valid reasons I have met so far that would mean that this front may bear down on you more than others amounts to just 1, ill health. 

Anything beyond ill health we all essentially have. Ironically the way ill health is currently addressed by HR strategies would be a fundamental pillar of what our Unity must address, and can only address in a unified way. 

I as a man of the Union hate this fence. I hate a divide of the pilots of any sort, but I am also happy enough if we have brought it down to just one divide. If we have our ultimate way then this divide is the last of a dying breed only to be replaced by none at all. Remember we were once divided 4,000 individual ways, so we have come a long way. 

What those who weren’t there will not know was that with each of our 5 strikes in 2018 there were those who joined us each time for the first time. When they joined us it was those people that we celebrated most, not ourselves. I myself called for the round of applause for them. They were the sign and mark of our future, and they still are. 

People who cross the fence are the future for those of us already here. Anybody in doubt about what lies beyond on either side should remember this. 

It doesn’t matter in this fight what we were before as much as it matters who we will be from here forward. That statement remains true in this case whether it refers to all of us - on either side, or just to you - on either side.

[2019-06-27 09:32:49] <kilroyrobin> When Ryanair say we earn *Up to* €200,000 PA as Captain (which they are at again - and its hardly for old times sake) I can't help but think they must be anticipating a highly successful Union campaign in 2019 if they suggest we will earn *up to* that much more than we ever have in the last decade!! (I mean they couldn't just lie - right?:zany_face:) They must actually know what all the busy busy people I am lucky enough to know are really *up to* behind the scenes. I hope you all do too. A lot of people are *up to* a lot of things these days, trust me (An old General never looses his rank they say, but an old Chairman never looses his phone - and it's long list of numbers:kissing_closed_eyes:). Make sure you members are *up to* it too, and while you are at it make sure the person beside you is *up to* it too. It's *up to* everybody, of course its *up to* our elected leaders, but its also *up to* you, and whoever you can get *up to* it too. (edited)

[2019-06-28 11:28:20] <padibartolomeo> Does anyone know how U/L is calculated ? Is it gross salary / 365 or anything else ? 
[2019-06-28 12:10:58] <felix.bamesreiter> It is basic+allowance+productivity divided by 260 working days in a year multiplied by the number of unpaid leave days taken. That's the answer I got from payroll last year but it might change as they wish 
[2019-06-28 12:13:25] <gustav.andregard> Same here, take home of 43,5%, never happened before? 
[2019-06-28 12:25:51] <brendanjacobs> You may also get your total monthly fixed figures divided by the number of working days on your pattern in that month, multiplied by the number of days taken. Or the 1/365 as you suggested. But who knows, it all depends on nothing related to reason or transparency. You’ll have deducted whatever they want and no matter how logical your arguments as to why they shouldn’t have made the deduction, you still won’t get a satisfactory answer. 
[2019-06-28 12:41:24] <jwarren> I was given the same answer as Felix. Anyway,  as a Cpt in Italy, expect to have about €320 per day of u/l deducted from your gross salary.

FCI says checklist will be:
*STAB TRIM
*PERFORMANCE/W&amp;B
*EFB
(...)

Checklist actually is:
*STAB TRIM
*PERFORMANCE/W&amp;B
*PHONES ????

And the funny thing is the checklist in the QRH is still the old one saying nothing about Performance/W&amp;B.... but dated 21st March as well

Still following me? Well here it comes:
In CGN we are operating for Malta Air, where the FCOM has not been updated but we are flying with the revision 30 checklist and QRH

She did so by default -or did she, she was dragged into it - or was she, whatever way we got there, we got there through thick and thin, just as couples do. 

In the end we both had to fight like hell to change a mentality that none of us would raise our kids to follow or become. We along with all the others in the vortex of change. As many as ever were there still are, and they fight just as hard as ever and with bigger plans than ever. 

For every fighter in our fight there is another beside them, they had to cross the fence of fear just like any other, mortgages, debt, kids, dependents, often single income and all the other precious parts of life that seem to fall in the sights of an absolute greed. 

These companions to the march do indeed understand exactly the culture of fear they fight. They live through it, or sometimes under it too, it was their own family that a mindless and heartless management fool would tear apart by the hundreds to feed a long failed model of mindless share price servitude. 

The blind obsession with the expansion of a house of cards rather than consolidation of a tower of strength costs our company just as it costs us and our families. So in the end just as always happens, and it seems must always happen, the Pilots hold the line. By default so does a partner without whom the line would rarely stand, but for whom it must stand just as much as anyone. 

Family first. Safety first. If you are sincere about either then there is no difference between the two. Neither should be seen as parts to strip and sell for profit, wake up Boeing, wake up anyone else we might know who’s also lost their most basic moral compass. We know a few alright.

A Judge has already called it what it is. We know what it is, the question is do we accept it, do we accept the threats of others. Do we accept our families as pawns to profit. No?

No and you’re based in the U.K.? No and you’re based in Ireland? No and you’re based in Germany? No and you’re based in Spain? No and you have a Union? Now is your chance then!! Tell your council you don’t accept what happened in EIN, NRN or BRE or in the mystery 14 other bases being kept as a ‘surprise’ for us now. After all we are supposed to cower before fear in 2019 just as any other year. Take it or leave it. Take it or leave your home! Tell you’re colleagues too, tell them we need not just to ask for change, but be the change. 

Call it what you like but base closure bullying is base closure bullying. This has to end or else we will find it has only just begun. 

The Barley as it rises again and again each year has been a symbol to the Irish for over two centuries now. Some things in life just stay the same. To all our friends in VNV or VC who lost their base I might quote our rebel song on the sad farewells we all were threatened with and risked, but in the end you ultimately took with you from the fight, but the song is also for the rising over and over again in to the fight, year after year just like the Barley. 

*”twas hard the mournful words to frame to break the ties that bound us 
Ah, but harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us 
And so I said, "The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early 
And join the brave united men" while soft wind shook the barley”*

My Grandfather fought on the Somme.. and then subsequently at Menin Road bridge and at what some commentators say was the worst of all Passchendaele, during the third battle of Ypres. He joined up for the hell of it and as he said in later life, for the solidarity with smaller nations. During the battle of Passchendaele he did something pretty selfless. At the end of this horrific conflict, he stood among 4 of the Irish Guards Regiment who were recognised for such selfless acts for the love of his comrades. He was lucky, he lived. 2 of those great men had been honoured posthumously. Throughout his life he played his personal history down often saying he was just doing what any man would do for his friends. Most people don’t get the chance. He did. 

I take a lot of life’s cues from my Grandfather. He was a military man. Another great military man poignantly reflected on his grandson asking him “Grandpa... were you a hero in the war? “ To which Grandpa replied “No... but I served in a company of hero’s”. 

On 13th September 2017, unbelievably coincidently - 100 years to the day since my Grandfather defended his comrades with his Lewis gun in Flanders, I met a gang of my colleagues in Bishops Stortford for a curry and a few pints. 4 of those colleagues were senior management. 2 of them were also military men. During dinner I sat beside one of them who I admire, delighting in pissing him off every 10 minutes telling him to get out of the way so that I could go for a smoke. 

There was chat aplenty, sometimes robust when the crisis with the “rostering failure” was spoken about, always broken by a smoke break. The conversation somehow came around to WW1. I relayed my Grandfathers story. My colleague beside me stood up and shook my hand saying “It’s an honour Sir”. The other across the table stood up and saluted me. This extraordinary occurrence left a lasting impression on me. The conversation had been sometimes fractious yet these two management colleagues, principled men with ingrained priorities, taught me a valuable lesson .... 

There is much more to life than fighting dirty wars, however those dirty wars MUST be fought. :reminder_ribbon:

[2019-07-08 03:30:44] <kilroyrobin> The question is not always what brought a man to war, but what he did when war came to him. There is not a General in our fight for Unity and change who does not salute you for what you have done here, the difference in 2019 is that the salute is your own salute. To reshape not only a union, but an army of unions into fighting form is a level of determination and stubbornness that is quite honestly and quite evidently only found in one man in about five thousand, and for that you have my salute.

Died leading his men into the battle according to the letter that accompanied his watch home. He never came home and left 4 boys to grow without him. Their fight no doubt was incomparable to ours, and yet we still have fools here in our labour war of letters, lawyers, bullies and mediation who still find reason to lie crippled by fear in a muddy memo shell hole shivering at the whistle of another crewdock compulsory read. You keep the head down for shells or lead, not for memos. Come on every one of us, over the top. It’s ‘perceived’ fear we fight, not real fear.

[2019-07-11 08:54:10] <robwatts99> When he returned I was talking to a couple of union minded long timers who knew peter from years back. Their opinion was he was a decent type and they were actually optimistic he would bring change for the better. I don't know the man at all so maybe these guys were way off the mark. Saying that it could explain the sudden departure. He came back and was told he would be able to make changes but kept coming up against roadblocks and got pissed off with how things are been run. 

As I said I know nothing of the man apart from bullshit memos so I could be way off the mark but could be an explanation. I do know that we will end up with another lapdog in HQ getting a promotion because he will do exactly as told and knows only the RYR way.

Robby Garland, Tom Flood, Glen Healy and I walked to the negotiating table with instructions from our members to get what they had balloted for, or let them march for it. We took heavy attacks from front and back. You can prepare all you like but once the door is closed and you are in the fight anything can happen, except if you bring the right people in with you so that between you all you have what it will take to win. Only with the four of us standing together could we bring out of that room a chance to fight for what the Ballot demanded. We stood together through my version of hell, at least there was no shortage of devilish tricks there. A year later and everything we were told was “mathematically impossible” or “unimplementable” is now implemented. My sincerest and eternal thanks to Tom, Glen and Robby for the fight we put in together. My thanks also to everyone of you who gave us the support and strength to walk in that door and do what had to be done, and ultimately for sticking together until the job was done. What a band of brothers and sisters we all became. I choose today to remember Council members across the network who continue to walk in to my version of hell this year, just as we did before, many of whom are the very same people, and some of whom are new. May we give them strength, all of us. They will need all of us. We all are the fire in their chamber without which no bullet of change can fly.

[2019-07-11 18:15:14] <tomflood737> Always a pleasure to read Captain Kilroy’s posts - and I use Captain, as it should be in our profession, as opposed to their “mister” which some of your Elected Company Council Members have been referred to in previous correspondence from FR.

I’ve had many a proud moment in my life but no words can describe what we collectively achieved on the 12th last year. 

We fought against an unfair disadvantage, or what would have been “perceived” as an unfair disadvantage. We fought and collectively we won. 

We have lost two COO’s since the “management crash of 2017” - we have lost many key figures n HQ, but the problem is still  there. 

Someone needs to identify the bogey engine and shut it down - they’ve had two years, while, we only get 400 feet. 

Anyway - whatever happens from here on in they can never take this time last year away. 

As Pilots we are trained to identify the problem - your Company Councils are working hard to find the solution to save our Company and will continue to do so with your mandated support. 

Time to bring our Company to a safe landing before bingo fuel. (edited)

Although the politics of the time seem different now in the context of the century now passed, it was borne of the ones that came before it. The dirty employers paws rummaging into the pockets of their own workers remains identical though, just as the benefits of those who fought our fight a hundred years ago remain as relevant as ever. To accept the notion of the contractor is to accept the loss of every win in the history of labour relations. Every nation has their history, this man wrote ours and coined the slogan "A fair day's work for a fair day's pay". He didn’t live the life described here so that unpaid crews would work shifts on airport standby or any other work unpaid. Never forget the harm the bogus employment model has done even with the thin end of its wedge. If we let them drive the wedge home then what will be left? We would already know the answer if we had not taken our stand in 2017 and 2018, it’s a very good thing that we did or the charge to undo centuries of work would be all but done, such is the efficiency of our talented managers. Apparently it falls to us to turn their talents forward instead of backwards.  attachments: [{"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/2\/23\/James_Larkin.jpg","image_width":220,"image_height":287,"image_bytes":23868,"title":"James Larkin","title_link":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Larkin","from_url":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Larkin","author_name":"Wikipedia","author_link":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/","text":"James Larkin (21 January 1876 \u2013 30 January 1947), sometimes known as Jim Larkin, was an Irish republican, socialist and trade union leader. He was one of the founders of the Irish Labour Party, Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Workers' Union of Ireland (the two unions later merged to become SIPTU, Ireland's largest trade union) and the Irish Citizen Army (a paramilitary group which was integral to both the Dublin Lockout and the Easter Rising).\nLarkin was born to Irish parents in Liverpool, England. He and his family later moved to a small cottage in Burren, southern County Down. Growing up in poverty, he received little formal education and began working in a variety of jobs while still a child. He became a full-time trade union organiser in 1905. Larkin moved to Belfast in 1907, but is perhaps best known for his role in the 1913 Dublin Lockout. Not long after the lockout, Larkin assumed direct command of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), and would later travel to America to raise funds for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU). During his time in America, Larkin became involved in the socialist movement there, becoming a member of the Socialist Party of America. After being jailed in 1920 in the US for 'criminal anarchy', he was pardoned in 1923 and later deported, and returned to Ireland where he again became involved in Irish socialism and politics both in the Labour Party and the Irish Worker League. Larkin served as a Teachta D\u00e1la on three occasions and died in 1947. The ICA escorted his funeral procession through Dublin in its last public appearance.\nLarkin was respected by some commentators during and after his lifetime, with George Bernard Shaw describing him as the \"greatest Irishman since Parnell\", and his friend and colleague in the labour movement James Connolly describing him as a \"man of genius, of splendid vitality, great in his conceptions, magnificent in his courage\". \"Big Jim\" Larkin continues to occupy a position in Dublin's collective memory and streetscape, with a statue of him unveiled on O'Connell Street in 1979.","fallback":"wikipedia: James Larkin","service_icon":"https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/bfaba\/img\/unfurl_icons\/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Larkin"}]

In the other hand, pilot autonomy has been eroded so much that we can no longer make a logical decision. There are two types of 4 reds and 4 whites

The ISA dev is supposed to be for the average ISA dev during the descent so that the FMC can optimise the descent profile.

[2019-07-12 23:33:41] <grahamkendall13> On this theme am I supposed to file an ASR for a soft sink-rate caution @100-200ft that was corrected immediately?  (after vnav dumps you on 3 and a bit whites on a 3.5deg path with a 32degree OAT with thermals) (edited)

---- 2019-07-13 ----
[2019-07-13 03:09:38] <gustav.andregard> @grahamkendall13 no, a caution should only be to correct the path, so unless it's any additional things to report It should be correct, continue and forget about the approach walking home 
[2019-07-13 07:22:55] <tuhhodge> A sink rate will still be flagged by the OFDM and appear in your POSI, probably together with a high ROD marker as well.

	:+1: grahamkendall13
[2019-07-13 11:00:00] <gustav.andregard> Had a sink rate last summer on a 3,5 glide in Morocco, quickly grabbed the stick and helped the fo correct it and it never triggered any OFDM, at least not so it was reported on the monthly email 
	:+1: grahamkendall13
[2019-07-13 12:34:46] <iglehane> There’s usually a 3-5 second grace period before it triggers the OFDM 
[2019-07-13 13:14:04] <kilroyrobin> Only person I’ve heard get trouble over a sink rate was when they got 2 x sink rates going through 300’ on a circle to land. Technically they were not considered stable in this event, even though you might argue you had pre briefed that a high rate was possible and therefore acceptable. I once got a sink rate with a cadet that generated a written pull up on the PFD, but *no pull up call sounded* so I continued. I reported it and there was a lot of puzzlement about how that happened, but I got no trouble for it... mind you that was before I joined the Council. If you’re in the Council and it’s raising questions go around :wink:.....the rest of you can probably carry on like I used to. Ahh but it’s worth it. Bloody well worth it.  
[2019-07-13 13:51:45] <gustav.andregard> A sink rate will trigger a pull up indication on the PFD,  got bit of a scare when I looked down and grabbed the controls with the sink rate caution thought same as Robin that I somehow never got the aural pull up. But according to FCOM2, SINK RATE comes with a pull up visual indication, correct me if I'm wrong but pull up only announces in red? 
[2019-07-13 17:50:02] <kilroyrobin> Could well be, I must look it up, the main thing is that the lanyard announces in yellow of course.  
	:facepunch: apfoley
[2019-07-13 20:10:56] <padibartolomeo> Sink rate will generate the aural “sink rate” warning and a red pull up flag on the pfd.All you have to do is correct the path. If that happens to turn into a “terrain pull up” or any hard warning  you must perform the terrain escape manoeuver. (edited)
[2019-07-13 22:36:48] <tuhhodge> Mine was into Lanzerote on that V/S offset approach that requires a high descent rate. I went around with the Pull Up and sink rate aural. Good decision at the time. Both OFDM items highlighted in my POSI but one wonders if anything would have been noted if I hadn't filed an ASR. 
[2019-07-13 22:38:30] <tuhhodge> Carrying red bags will become even more worrying

[2019-07-14 07:31:05] <johnmurray737> Don’t worry about the posi lads. Nearly all “experienced” FOs wait until 3.8 now for the gear.  So much so that when I ask for the gear at 4.2-4.5 they are taking about 10secs until they action it. It makes for an interesting dynamic in the flight deck. 
Did I ask you for gear down ? ...yes
Was I high on speed for flaps? .... no
Why did you not select them when asked?..”eh
But you shouldn’t select flaps until 3.8.”
We are back to lads worried about flying the ofdm / posi and not the ac. All fields on posi have been selected by Ray and his cronies to manipulate people into new sops just to save fuel etc and it has worked. Posi does not relate to airmanship. Fly the ac. Don’t mention posi in any discussion it only belittles the pilots position. If one goes about their day with a bit of professionalism the posi will look after its self. If the aircraft talks back to you maybe hit the togas, reevaluate and give it a second attempt. Other than that continue if safe to do so.

[2019-07-16 13:51:15] <albertbessler> I queried the death in service benefit and they referred me to the Ryanair rough guide. It says very little, three lines. So I’ve asked how my spouse would go about claiming the benefit if I died. 

The last thing you want, if you loose a spouse is to be dealing with some random company that your partner worked for. I’ll post back with the procedure. 
[2019-07-16 15:35:30] <padibartolomeo> Thanks Albert for the effort . This is something new to many of us , which of course is rarely investigated . However , is the lump sum paid by Willis or is it something the company has to pay through their insurance ? 
[2019-07-16 17:44:30] <albertbessler> It’s a company insurance policy. In the Ryanair rough guide it states a payout of twice your basic if you meet certain health criteria.  
[2019-07-16 18:14:01] <damiano.detomassi> Having a class 1 should be enough . But I remember was dead during duty . If it’s in service as “being employed “ it is a good perk .

A visual “Pull up” annunciation on the PFD is a soft warning not requiring a terrain escape maneuver. 
(I checked this many years ago when I executed said maneuver in the SIM after “we” forgot to inhibit the “too low flaps” warning for SE approach and was told off by TRE.)

A hard warning is aural and visual according to FCOM.

He was a very pleasent person (I know there is other storries about him as wel), but it was clear his options were limited due people above him. Now -with a different CEO-... who knows... he might evolve and be a good part of the EZY-Team. Time will tell (edited)
[2019-07-18 07:45:31] <ronan.walsh22> I’d say ur right Arpad. It’s a shame he wasn’t let turn this place into another easy jet but we all know who needs to go in order to change Ryanair.

[2019-07-19 16:26:54] <spac> I thought they pocketed €900M last financial year? I thought they banked €1.1B the year before?
If the personnel manager cannot do simple arithmetic, what is the company doing by letting somebody so incompetent, engage with a union?
Speculating about what other companies may, or may not do, is disingenuous, what BALPA may or not have recommended for other unions is irrelevant.
The implied threat of base closures is noteworthy. The company exists solely to massage the egos of those on the board, and it executes that massage by making money. As long as any base creates wealth it will stay open. The *ONLY* reason for any closure, is exclusively as punishment for a perceived misdemeanour. Nota bene Eindhoven, and the result of legal action against Ryanair by those affected by that closure.
That fuel costs may have risen is down to the company not having hedged its fuel costs in a proper fashion, again irrelevant when discussing T&amp;Cs.
The company should show its workforce proper respect. Reinstating the share-option/profit share, that they as a board seem to enjoy, and was originally a relevant part of the remuneration for Ryanair pilots, would go some way towards redeeming the disdain 'management' have shown towards all staff in recent times .
I suggest BALPA ask the company directly why that was removed, but never restored.

There should be a motion of No Confidence in the board, tabled at the AGM.

[2019-07-21 11:10:22] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FLM2ZUFFS with text: I believe this photo was taken by Patricia King towards the end of the final day of mediation on August 23rd 2018 which ran through the night until after 7am. There were 7 names on the original letter to Ryanair announcing the members of the IALPA Company Council, there were several such letters from the other MA’s at the time also, but there are many more people now who have eclipsed these original names and played equally critical roles. They have not just lead change but they have also continued our charge for more change. 

There are exceptional stories you already know, such as Captain Enda Ryan marching in the front door of BALPA, flinging out the fat by the scruff and then marching out of ECA not only with a functioning RTPG, but also as it’s President, however there are other stories too such as the story I wish to tell here. 

One of the founding principles motivating every action and risk taken by council members across Europe was to address the incredible inability to retain staff and their invaluable experience in our Airline. We were appalled by the experience ‘brain drain’ that eroded our critical margins. Accountants love it, but no pilot could ever call Pilot Churn good airmanship. We are not a flight school for one very good reason - our passengers. 

Early on in this round of the fight it became obvious that this time we would finally bring change. People could see it, our perfect storm was here and we would drive the hell out of it. At times like that many conversations happened on the way to the car park, but one in particular was inspiring to me. One pilot who I had known and respected for 2 decades told me that he was so motivated by what the Council was doing that he had cancelled a successful job offer elsewhere. He had decided to stay and be a part of the change here. That showed me that already we were beginning to fix the problem, little did I know that I was face to face with a man who would become one of the most significant, gifted and determined strategists in the entire movement. 

At first he began appearing anywhere work needed doing, simple stuff until we realised this would be a very short apprenticeship indeed. Things started getting ticked off the job lists at an ever increasing rate, and at an ever more skilful level. Eight months later he was walking into mediation beside Tom, Andy and I carrying with him a skill set we all absolutely depended on. 

This man was Captain Glen Healy, second from left in the picture. When I stepped down as Vice President of the Ryanair Transnational Pilot Group he stepped forward and was elected to represent all of you in this critical role along side President Enda Ryan. Since stepping down I have been privileged to have a ring side view of all that happens in the furnace of change. I can therefore tell you that all that happens on Enda &amp; Glens watch happens at an exceptional level of skill and with a tactical accuracy that is in my view as near unbeatable as can be done with the resources we have. 

I believe that Glen with his modest disposition and indifference to praise or back patting may be less known to many of you. He has a self sufficiency in his resolve and determination that leaves little time for talking about change while the time could be spent bringing actual change about. In Ireland members will soon attend Pilot meetings, it is important that all realise at these meetings that in Glen Healy you will be speaking to one of our primary strategists and most significant and best informed contributors in our fight for change. 

What I like about his story, and the reason I tell it here is that the most significant thing Glen arrived with was determination. All the other skills he honed and perfected in a matter of months. In the long term others will have to replace the current Company Councils if the changes we bring are to be changes we keep.

[2019-07-21 17:44:03] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FLM6M9ZAR with text: *WHY SHOULD ALL MEMBERS IN ANY NATION BE ON SLACK?*

In 2017 when this round of our fight for change began our traditional communications patterns became completely overwhelmed. I remember landing and turning on my phone and WhatsApp informed me I had 542 messages. At the time we tried to beat this problem by writing a daily roundup of events called “No time to read all these?” because important points were being lost in the emoji noise of idle conversations. The point is that WhatsApp works for groups of 20 or less, but we are 5000 pilots. We need to be able to talk in groups of a thousand or more. 

Many of those who were close to the heart of things in 2017 and 2018 will now be completely un-phased by the standard and familiar Union busting threats and tricks that are being played out now by management, memo by memo. The trouble is that while people favour communication on platforms that do not facilitate wider transnational conversation we are divided even in those platforms where we discuss tactics in confidence. We simply cannot afford miss information, especially not where it is borne of mistakes we have made before and already mitigated before.

In the End “No time to read all these” evolved and developed into a daily publication where a thousand Pilots could be helped along with deciphering the lies that are pedalled in times of Industrial Action. In the end those who engaged with Slack became so well informed that the publication of what was by that time known as the “Daily Dose” became redundant. This was a good thing because it took many many pilots hundreds of voluntary hours to keep that publication going in order to straighten out the truth for the benefit of our members. 

Slack also took hundreds of hours to develop, you don’t get half the pilots in FR to join one single group without some serious legwork. The frustration for those who put in the time in reaching a solution here is to now see the problem flare up again where WhatsApp groups from anywhere and everywhere may be found once again incorrectly blaming Company Councils for things that have been maliciously placed to deliver exactly that kind of discontent. Miss-information now plays a terrible own goal if we allow it to do so. We need to get on one platform. Remember - Divided we fail.

Now I know Slack is not Facebook or instagram, we use a platform that some find dated, but the facts are these. Slack has been used successfully by the Norwegian Pilot Group for several years, we took their advice and used it too. In 2017 and 2018 we used Slack very successfully to keep folks together. Slack is free, Slack is already up and running. On a more practical level Slack allows a much more category headed conversation for ease of future reference and to cut out the noise that is not of interest to you. It is also still possible to speak in small and trusted groups within Slack that others cannot see should you feel that need but yet access the total view of everything happening at home or abroad. 

Proposing another platform is useless unless you are offering an army of people to set it up using hundreds of hours of the free time similar to what we already used to get Slack up and running, and - the crunch - you’ll need to have it done in a week!. We are in the run up to IA now, if you do not understand the language of Union Busting and Industrial relations you are going to find this a lot tougher than you need to, worse still you may bail out unnecessarily from a clear opportunity to bring change for all of us. Trying to change platforms now is like calling Heuston for a different rocket half way to the moon. The only sensible option now is to make the rocket we already have fly.

The challenge is not fighting management, the challenge is for your Council to be successful in informing the members with one hand even while the other hand is negotiating with management. We need your help, sign up to Slack, keep yourself and those around you informed - and share this wherever you like if it will bring more in to Unity.

I used this, apply online, cost about €50 and took about 2 weeks to arrive. There used to be a postal application but seems it has to be done online now. It says on the site it’s for visa applications to other countries but it’s all that I could find

[2019-07-23 05:56:35] <brendanjacobs> An excess of 300 pilots and I’m still being called at 4:20am on my day off! I am making the assumption they were looking for me to work a day off. Maybe it was just to offer me unpaid leave!

[2019-07-23 09:29:31] <boswellbrown> Perhaps it’s a surplus of 300 on a particular day across the network if all those pesky pilots on summer leave are taken into account... so not really available to fly. :grin:

[2019-07-23 18:27:43] <caitlinharm> Anyone been in a situation where they’ve needed cleaners and they weren’t available? After 20 minutes of backwards and forwards between the dispatcher, ops and the base’s supervisor, our number 2 was fed up and was adamant that she was going to use some latex gloves and do the job herself. Anyone come up with a better solution?  
[2019-07-23 18:41:31] <kilroyrobin> That’s unusual, normally the situation resolves itself quickly because the crew refuse point blank to clean up bodily fluids, and this causes  unavailable cleaners to suddenly appear after all. Probably the No.2 has kids, had no babysitter, had to get home, and is by default used to cleaning up worse while eating a rushed breakfast with the other hand.

[2019-07-23 18:53:18] <derekfdoyle> We had this problem in Reus last Saturday.  No cleaners available in Reus. I was told to tell the cabin crew to clean it.  I told them we would wait for them to come over from Barcelona or Girona.  After 30 minutes the dispatcher arrived with the necessary equipment and cleaned the mess up.

[2019-07-23 18:53:20] <caitlinharm> She had dealt with the same family who made the mess being particularly awkward for the last 2 hours and I think she just wanted to go home, Robin! The dispatcher just kept repeating that there was no cleaners until the evening and the airport cleaners don’t have ID to enter the aircraft. Didn’t even get any joy from Operations when they called. I don’t understand how a base (albeit a Ryanair Sun one) have no access whatsoever to any sort of cleaners. Wish I could have helped her out more, she deserved a medal after today!  
[2019-07-23 19:18:12] <edward.scurr> Dig your heels in, it’s amazing how quickly cleaners can be found when you tell the dispatcher and ops that you’re not moving till the cleaners arrive. Actually it’s amazing how quickly anything can be achieved when you tell operations what’s what.  
[2019-07-23 19:33:27] <rballen> I had it in NRN a few years ago and the dispatchers told me that Ryanair’s contract with the handling agent stated if no cleaners were available, the handling agent themselves would have to do it. I don’t know if that was specific to NRN or network-wide.  
[2019-07-23 20:18:07] <boston58730> Waited 45 mins for cleaners in TLS few months back. 

Had no cleaners available at STN 18 months ago on a Sunday with uncle Ray on the JS. Ended up in an AC change. Penny rich, ... also pound rich in this case but mighty embarrassing. 
[2019-07-23 20:46:23] <ginosabatino> Same in zaz. Not a single cleaner in airport. In the end ground lads came in with grit that you use on an oil spillage... 
[2019-07-23 20:51:04] <ginosabatino> They are not a competitor airline. They do not fly the 737-8200. It’s completely different

[2019-07-23 22:04:06] <boswellbrown> Yup... sat on the ground in BRS waiting for cleaners, surprisingly, for BRS, none available. It really was a proper mess. Told CC not to clean... and they certainly weren’t keen. Ops unhappy... tuff turkey, sort it out folks! Departed one hour late.

[2019-07-26 16:29:14] <kilroyrobin> Some of you will be used to seeing the likes of me and a few other regulars banging on and on about the Union, but this post in <#C93EKC1AP|ma_balpa> has generated some stories by reply from other members which describe in such honesty what it means and takes to join the fight. I think they top the tables of what folks who may feel doubts as our fight approaches might benefit from reading. The heart felt and honest replies to the attached post are an outstanding account of the road we all need to take. Better still why don’t some others from across the network add to the accounts with stories from their own part of the march for change that is here at last. attachments: [{"fallback":"[July 25th, 2019 6:10 PM] kilroyrobin:  Untitled","ts":"1564074646.060400","author_id":"U96U9BGJW","author_subname":"Robin Kilroy","channel_id":"C93EKC1AP","channel_name":"ma_balpa","is_msg_unfurl":true,"is_thread_root_unfurl":true,"author_name":"Robin Kilroy","author_link":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/team\/U96U9BGJW","author_icon":"https:\/\/avatars.slack-edge.com\/2018-02-09\/312413506913_8def8f06a265bad3f415_48.png","mrkdwn_in":["text"],"from_hidden_wksp":false,"files":[{"id":"FLEMM2HR9","created":1564074646,"timestamp":1564074646,"name":"-.txt","title":"Untitled","mimetype":"text\/plain","filetype":"text","pretty_type":"Plain Text","user":"U96U9BGJW","editable":true,"size":5369,"mode":"snippet","is_external":false,"external_type":"","is_public":true,"public_url_shared":false,"display_as_bot":false,"username":"","url_private":"https:\/\/files.slack.com\/files-pri\/T92DBBHJ6-FLEMM2HR9\/-.txt","url_private_download":"https:\/\/files.slack.com\/files-pri\/T92DBBHJ6-FLEMM2HR9\/download\/-.txt","permalink":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/files\/U96U9BGJW\/FLEMM2HR9\/-.txt","permalink_public":"https:\/\/slack-files.com\/T92DBBHJ6-FLEMM2HR9-201d65fa97","edit_link":"https:\/\/ryr-pilot-association.slack.com\/files\/U96U9BGJW\/FLEMM2HR9\/-.txt\/edit","preview":"SO THE MEETINGS ARE DONE, THE BALLOT IS IN, WHAT HAPPENS NOW, WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE?\n\nIn 2018 and the run up to industrial action we encouraged coffee mornings for groups of people who knew each other to talk things over and straighten out any concerns.

[2019-07-29 18:35:57] <kilroyrobin> *If, By Rudyard Kipling* 

If you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: 

If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings 
And never breathe a word about your loss
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

[2019-07-29 18:36:12] <kilroyrobin> On the 27th of July 2018 100 Irish pilots received their protective notice and were to be sent to Poland. Around this time last year our fight was very very real indeed. I stood at the top of a room before we walked out to picket HQ, in that gathering of the brave I read every word of this poem, not one man or woman looked away, no one drifted off or balked or sniggered at reading prose to what might ordinarily be the most unlikely choice of company, but we were not in ordinary times. In those days these men and women lived every word of ‘IF’, they listened to the end, they earned every bit of these timeless lines. ‘IF’ has belonged to many over the last century, but it belongs to us now too.

<https://vimeo.com/350780012/5abde31242>

So they hit at the Irish, British and German basis, job losses for all said nations just after August, oh and of course more around Christmas. It seems like crews in these countries are now supposed to not strike due to fear, I suggest he hires a new union buster. 

Are we now to sit back and quietly wait for the gas to emerge from the vents. F#ck that, I say everybody mentioned there better get ready to fight like hell since this has given you nothing to loose. 

Why don’t they tell their budget union buster friends that if you give an army no way out alive they are bound to fight to the last bullet and then to death by any means. 

Oh by the way those losses (of the vast profit) we hear about are because of an uncertainty borne of a now ridiculous inability to lead this companies employees - the same employees who will still bring in just short of a Billion euros profit in 2019 (by Ryanair’s own estimates). That’s a thousand millions. (You’re welcome!)

Leading is different to herding, you herd sheep, you lead people. Think about it! That’s why there are so many sheep dogs around, but no people dogs. 

Anyway, let’s not get too upset, the share price will double in 2021 when Max’s are sure to be here in force, and  by then the weaker competition will have long faded (by Ryanair’s own forecast) so then the trade war can of course end and seats will sell for solid Gold again, then Ryanair Land will grow money on trees, just as long as it has experienced loyal staff who know how to fly, and fly safely. 

We might then at last be Always Getting Better.  attachments: [{"service_name":"Vimeo","service_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/","title":"29.07.19 MOL Update","title_link":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/350780012\/5abde31242","author_name":"Inhouse","author_link":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user8099270","thumb_url":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/802166600_295x166.jpg","thumb_width":295,"thumb_height":166,"text":"","fallback":"Vimeo Video: 29.07.19 MOL Update","video_html":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/350780012?autoplay=1&app_id=122963\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"29.07.19 MOL Update\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","video_html_width":400,"video_html_height":225,"from_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/350780012\/5abde31242","service_icon":"https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/bfaba\/img\/unfurl_icons\/vimeo.png","id":1,"original_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/350780012\/5abde31242"}]

Just signed a deal with a school in poland last week to keep pipe line open.

They still plan to be moving 200m people in a few years, the lead time to train people to drive these 200 new jets is huge. The sims will be planned for next 18months.

2. Winter, 
3. Spring
4. Summer .... 

it’s as sure as night follows day. 
Anybody who has been here in this company through the ‘take it or leave it’ implementation of even one base deal will already know the pattern. Anybody who has been here in Ryanair for over 5 years will be so completely familiar with this endlessly repeating pattern that it is a sequence every bit as sure as the seasons. Just ask around if you’re new. The steps are these; 

1. Doom gloom and threats of base closures, revert to 5:3 etc. 

2. Pay cuts, loss in terms and conditions, increase in productivity at zero sum cost to company.

3. Everything returns to normal (SARS, swine flu, fuel prices, overcapacity, base closures, Max, or sick chickens in Mongolia suddenly all okay again)

4. Record profits for shareholders and vast payouts for senior executives.

5. Start at 1 again and repeat. 

There’s just one problem - it won’t wash with your Union! Vote now!!

[2019-07-30 22:24:40] <kilroyrobin> IS IT TRUE THAT IF I GO ON STRIKE MY BASE WILL CLOSE AND I’LL BE SACKED?

This is a question of what we collectively choose to accept. If we do nothing it will happen to people anyway, ultimately you can be good as gold and still get it in the neck, it’s been like this for years, isn’t that why we are talking here. 

If we do fight they will weaponise their strategies accordingly, but look at Belfast and Glasgow, good as gold and yet commercial realities meant they still took the hit. 

So if I strike will it increase chances of my base getting closed? Well that depends on so many factors beyond your Control that you need to boil this down to see it for what it is. In the end this is not just about all of us, this is about you. 

When I look forward into a difficult time or difficult decisions I always consider how I will look back on it. I know for example that I look back on 2018 with absolute pride and peace of mind that my actions were to a standard and code I live by, except for one thing. We were unable to defend EIN, BRE and NRN, or the entire country of Poland. This makes me sick. 

So the attacks are coming again, they are recruiting now while declaring they will sack others, do you tolerate this? Would it match the code you live by to cower now while others are taken out into the street to have their jobs publicly shot against a wall for standing up. How proud would you be for keeping the head down and minding your own while the HR snipers pick off the others, bearing in mind that right now widespread unity would yield victory without question. 

Fumbling in the face of fear will help to bring the opposite. I have a home and young family to pay for, having to uproot me or my family for another job, or to raise my family on Skype would be a tragedy to me, however with my self respect intact I will raise a *self respecting* family - some how - come hell or high water. 

The idea now that I would not take a stand while it is patently clear that some of my own people, colleagues and friends from any base will be attacked before long for another’s senseless white knuckle grip on power is one that makes me sick to the core. I’m sick of it. 

Of all the options and possibilities facing me and my colleagues right now, inaction is the one I could bear the least. The shame of it, the shame of myself, it would disgust me. What would I have gained anyway at the end even if my job survived by chance, I would have played a fundamental role in destroying my job and my self respect to boot. A life of cowering and pleading! 

Nah, to hell with that, I will fight, when you brush away the contrived fear uncertainty and doubt its obvious - no decision was ever clearer. In the words of the SWAPA President; “Let’s get this done!”, 

Whatever about all the others - when it’s done each of us will have to live with ourselves. That’s what your true compass answers to, you just have to answer to it.

[2019-07-31 13:44:04] <brendanjacobs> Watch how sensibly BA deal with this. No company wants to just give in to a unions demands and will try what they can to prevent strike, like seek an injunction. However, once they have exhausted those options the only sensible thing left to do is actually negotiate and make the necessary concessions to avoid inflicting cancellations on your customers and forcing your staff to have to go through with IA.
Remember last year Management said the 5 days of strikes in Ireland were completely unnecessary, they were right, they were, all they had to do was sit down and actually negotiate and make some concessions. It all could have been avoided. (edited)

After an explanation of democracy on the drive in all agreed it made perfect sense and was fair, there was just one problem with the whole concept; 
“Dad, why do they use such a big word for democracy?”

“Probably because it’s a very old word, I think it’s Greek, and we use it for very important things, that’s even how you get a president!”

“Oh” 

“Dad since we’ve been good can we get chips?”

Every body goes to them with well presented requests representing industry norms. This is point blank refused on all fronts by HQ. All fronts go through national endeavours to break the deadlock, but ultimately folded arms across the table shouting “un-implementable, no basis in reality, mathematically impossible”, and reverting to an alternate ‘take it or leave it’ mentality on every turn can only result in one outcome in any negotiation. It doesn’t matter where you are, when a union is presented with take it or leave it bully boy tactics then the answer will come out the same everywhere. Seems like the same pattern has brewed again this year.

[2019-08-01 09:58:45] <dama> TNA TURBOFAN ENGINE ANALOGY

The workings of a Transnational Pilot Association such as the NPG, EPG, SPG &amp; RTPG can be likened to a jet engine. 
A jet engine has many parts working together in concert to produce thrust. Lots of it. It uses just two resources Air and fuel. Lets consider the pilots as the packets of air. 

The fan is comprised of blades or national pilots associations in our analogy. The fan blades move the air through our engine in an organised fashion. Some pilots bypass the core and pass along as fan-air while others get involved in the reaction and effort in the core that powers the whole assembly. Still fewer volunteer act as the local chambers of combustion, these are your Company Councils (CC’s). At the very heart of the engine of change these CC’s are the very few individuals whos electric determination and spark can ignite the fuel. 

The fuel is energy borne of the frustration of workers in a poorly managed company combined with their monetary contribution which when combined together propels us all forward in our cause. 

This is already an impressive machine, but power is nothing without control. It is necessary to finely control the motion of its various integral components. The combustion chambers should as far as posible all burn together equally. Equally a blade separation of an MA that departs the assembly results in tremendous loss of power and also a loss of any likelihood of success. The action of streamlining a common message to all moving parts is performed by the Transnational Pilot Group acting like an Engine Control Unit. Without this there would be frequent surges and stalls when combustion is uneven and some fan blades or MAs flex more than others or even separate at a cost to every other Pilot. 

No component can succeed alone, but our correctly assembled parts bring the only possible structure and regulatory certification of our engine of genuine change that is available under law.

We all know turbofans are a highly efficient compromise between fuel consumption and thrust, but equally we all know for dang sure a turbojet of equal diameter would be much more powerful. This would be our engine if everyone was a member. 

Members give some of their income to fuel this machine. On rare occasion they collectively decide to chip in more during strike days where income is lost. Make no mistake this money/fuel goes straight into nozzles and ignites at the very end of our engine, producing extraordinary amounts of negotiation power. Our equivalent of AFTERBURNER!!

The more pilots who contribute as close to the core as they can, the more we can achieve with our engine. There is no point in shouting that your MA is not providing thrust if we pilots are not providing either power or control. Every MA or blade is democratically answerable to its members. You must tell your MA that you want it rotating about the same bearing as others. A separated blade develops more damage than power, don’t let it be yours. 

If you choose the route of the bypass you are riding on the backs of other pilots, be a member, choose the core, drive the change we need. And when is it time to ignite the afterburner? Trust your engine control unit. On blades we fly but In thrust we trust.

‘Ryanair Sun to open a new base in VIE (Vienna) from end of October 2019.’

This just announced after Lauda notifies its staff of possible reductions/ job losses failing any agreement by Wednesday 14th August. So, before any final details have been made, Ryanair/ Lauda are in effect not willing to negotiate with its staff. It’s already clear that Ryanair/ Ryanair Sun is taking over this base from end of October. 

There is also work going on to get this interoperability in place before the base opens.

[2019-08-02 00:12:52] <tfreund.uk> Ryanair maths debunked as FUD


-----
MOL video: "profits have fallen by 41%"

Aside from the fact that any competent accounting dept. can doctor the profit/loss figures in either direction, this figure of 41% is mathematically incorrect because you cannot add up percentages in this way. e.g.: 100 minus 20% is 80, 80 minus 21% is 63.2. Compare 100 and 63.2 is 36.8% less, not 41% less. 

Just sayin'
It's all FUD


-----
MOL video: "only 30 MAX's by summer 2020, instead of 58 as planned"

Under the "2014 Boeing Contract" Ryanair expects 20 MAX's by 31/3/2020. Another 52 by 31/3/2021. So 30 MAXs by "summer" 2020 seems to be exactly as planned. 

The net increase in a/c in the Ryanair Group (including increase in A320 and planned returns/disposals) is 28 by 31/3/2020 and another 30 by 31/3/2021. So, the figure of 58 is the total net group fleet increase by 2021, not MAX deliveries by 2020. 

In the same sentence, MOL mentions surplus of 600 crew, which at 2019 crewing ratio is 17 a/c. The actual number of MAXs expected to be delivered by summer 2020 is therefore 13? 

Or is it all just FUD?


-----
further maths on "delay of MAX aircraft deliveries"

In his video, MOL mentions a shortfall of 28 a/c (from 58 down to 30) affecting 600 crew. 
In today's letter to BALPA, Ryanair mentions a shortfall of "at least 30" a/c affecting 900 crew.

According to the 2019 annual report, Ryanair's crewing ratio is 35.8 per a/c. Pilots per a/c is 11.6.

28 a/c = 1001 crew of which 324 pilots
30 a/c = 1073 crew of which 347 pilots
600 crew = 17 a/c and 194 pilots
900 crew = 25 a/c and 291 pilots

ie, none of Ryanair's numbers are correct. It's all just FUD.


-----
DH letter to Strutton: "500 surplus pilots"

on 31/3/19 (FY/2019 report) we had 11.6 pilots per a/c
2018 we had 11.2 pilots per a/c
2017 we had 10.1 pilots per a/c

The 2017 ratio was too low hence rostering crisis and increased ratio in 2018. Ratio increased further in 2019. 

Assuming the 2018 ratio is the "correct" one for RYR and the 2019 ratio was too high, this would mean we have 167 surplus pilots. Not 500.

However: Ryanair plans to have 499 aircraft on 31/3/2020.
at 2019 ratio we will need 5770 pilots by then 
at 2018 ratio we will need 5593 pilots by then
Therefore, we need to INCREASE our pilot workforce by 324 (or 147 at 2018 ratio) if we want to meet the 499 a/c target

500 surplus pilots? It's FUD.

Winter Grounding:

2017-18: 60 a/c = 15% of fleet
2018-19: 65 a/c = 15% of fleet
2019-20: if it's to be 15% again, should be 71 a/c

When they come out with a statement: "Ryanair will have to ground 71 a/c next winter due ... (Brexit/MAX/???)", we know one thing: it's merely FUD, because that is what they would have done anyway. (edited)

[2019-08-02 07:01:15] <brendanjacobs> Great work Thomas and don’t forget that ratio of pilots to a/c includes TRE’s/I’s and SFI’s, who at best, fly a quarter of the hours. The more aircraft and crew you have, the more training resources you need so the no more than 5.4 crew per a/c applied directly to ‘flying’ crew and not those in the sims or safety office etc.

If you want to share your understandings that you have gained from here and verbalise them elsewhere in your own way then that is to be encouraged but never share screen shots.

[2019-08-02 19:55:33] <masterharkin> *Redundancies*
I was just thinking today, that worrying and all as it is for Union members can you just imagine how worried you would be if you were facing this as a Non Union member.

Let’s say a small base with just a few aircraft is trimmed back. In a Union recognised airline there is a requirement to agree a redundancy structure with the Union that takes into account the downsizing protocol but get this:  A Union only has a mandate to represent its members and to make sure that any redundancies adhere to the seniority list and LIFO (last in first out). 

Q. Who do Non Union members turn to during a redundancy process?

A. Nobody?

Q. What does a Non Union member do if they are ceremoniously made redundant without company adherence to the laws and structures in place?

A. Nothing?

Q. Who will defend a Non Union member during redundancies?

A. Nobody?

*At times like this Professional Pilots are mad to risk not being in their Union.*

[2019-08-03 13:42:40] <jamiekerr513> I was wondering if anyone could help:

I'm switching to a Ryanair contract from 1st September. I have my month of in October. Will I be entitled to be paid for this? Or as I have been a contractor will they say I haven't built up the annual leave yet. 

Trying to get any info about anything including what pay I will be on is near impossible. 
[2019-08-03 13:45:27] <justincharbon> If I remember well, I did change 2yrs back as well just before my month off, I did get my basic for that month off. They might recalculate the AL days  
[2019-08-03 14:39:33] <sam.vanherzele> My guess is the following:
-basic should be paid for the month off if you're on contract 
-A/L days are built up at a ratio of 1.66 days/worked month (on employee contract). So if you start working sept 1, you will have 6,6 says of paid A/L that's year, the rest will be either not-available or OFF days.
Make sure they don't assign you unpaid leave as that will result in basic salary being deducted.  
[2019-08-03 14:57:09] <martin.loxbo> Had a similar situation as I went over to RYR contract in July with September and a block in July off. Got an email from rostering saying that left me with extra days off that I wouldn’t be entitled to have paid, so they changed these 9 days I believe to N/A. Looks like I got the basic for these days but no additional holiday pay which I guess makes sense. 
[2019-08-03 15:39:29] <masterharkin> Talk about a crises being mismanaged.

[2019-08-04 11:53:26] <kilroyrobin> Qatar Airways plan extra recruitment day for Ryanair pilots only Hilton Hotel Kilmainham Dublin - 11am &amp; 2pm this Tuesday 6th bring company ID for access.

I think it is a great result for the Unions that we have, with thanks to the support of our members, successfully given people enough hope to want to stay here in Ryanair. This is reflected in the decline in resignations. 

However with the barrage of recent demonstrations of ever more aggressive union busting techniques, which demonstrate complete contempt at executive level for everything the unions have done for Ryanair’s ability to retain Pilots, I regretfully understand why some of our invaluable and experienced Pilots may have had enough. 

For this reason see above news regarding Qatar. (edited)

With the possibility of zero 737 Max delivery’s the scurry will now start for second hand 737-800’s. Those old babies will be fetching top dollar now. 

Low cost airlines depend on more airplanes (mobile shops) and longer flights (opening hours) in order to grow their business. For 737 operators this is going to be a massive issue next year. For those lucky enough to be running an Airbus fleet like EasyJet, they are going to be the absolute knockout winners in 2020. 

Just imagine already having a purchasing agreement and an options agreement on hundreds of shinny new Airbus when your competitor has no options. 

It’s Easygrow for EasyJet in 2020!

[2019-08-06 17:59:52] <mischa_buijs> Well done lads 
[2019-08-06 18:01:09] <spac> No firm decisión until the end of the month, but there's no reason to believe middle/lower management would've been despatched to 'brief' anybody had the decision not actually already been made. 
[2019-08-06 18:07:55] <paul> I can think of a reason they would "brief" a possible base closure where there are about to be strikes even if they didn't plan to actually do anything. 
[2019-08-06 18:08:04] <mischa_buijs> Wise words, Mr. Magnusson!

[2019-08-07 03:14:07] <tfreund.uk> Just as a reminder, these are Ryanair's profit figures:
Q1.2018 €397m

Q1.2019 €319m
FY.2019 €1.02bn (excl.Laudamotion)
Q1.2020 €243m
FY.2020 €750m-950m (guidance)

ie. less profit, but still A LOT OF PROFIT

That day last year, well it was a long night but we got the Seniority Agreement out of it. 

This year, well it’s been a long year, but BALPA will get their deal, and it seems they may not be alone. 

Justice is a gift, Justice in the face of aggression is the perfect gift. Just another year older? No not really, a very important year for all of us, almost as hard as the next will be, but not nearly as hard as now would be if we were disarmed passengers on the eastbound train as was intended. 

Our Ryanair Sun was intended to set for all of us in the east, except now we rise again, rain or shine.

[2019-08-07 21:43:07] <tomflood737> Robin, the 22nd of July will never be forgotten, unfortunately we had no time to celebrate your birthday. 

Under the guidance of Patricia King, we worked for 20 hours (on day 5 of the Mediation process) if not longer. and we achieved something worthwhile, and like most worthwhile achievements won’t be truly recognized until long after the fact. 

To make the sacrifice of last year count - we need to dig deep this year. 

This year is different and will require every member to dig deep for the sake of our profession,


 
[2019-08-07 22:26:32] <kilroyrobin> Management have shown a complete commitment to not making union engagement work, any doubts on this could not have survived the last fortnight. Not only that but the AOC and base closure arsenal of weapons has been revealed to be all that we feared it was intended to be. 

Whichever union busters they have hired this year are better and harder than last year, or maybe it’s the same set of consultants who now know their enemy better. One thing is for sure, they see the companies greatest asset as their enemy. 

Blue crayon memos are not lethal enough to match the commands of the leaderships intentions now. I am hugely relieved that we have armed ourselves before this inevitable attack which now is levelled at us, especially now that it is so clear that this attack has been planned for a very long time. 

When did you first hear of Ryanair Sun, oh the accountants dream of watching us mutually destroy ourselves in an internal market that destroyed all sides must indeed be hard to let go. So now we fight because there is no other way. I am just glad we can.

[2019-08-07 23:35:24] <tomflood737> Love it. 

 
[2019-08-07 23:43:04] <oliver> Very nice, love it.
To bad it talks many times about being behind UK and irish pilots instead of all Ryanair pilots.
They probably didnt know the intricacies of our multi country system.
But I do appreciate their help immensely.

Oliver, I put the Italian flag first in the list in recognition of how difficult these intricacies have been for us all! It talks of UK and Irish pilots simply because we are both in the process of IA, no other reason. :it: :flag-ie::gb::de::flag-se::flag-ea::flag-be::flag-nl::flag-mf::flag-dk::flag-at::flag-mt::flag-pl::flag-ro::flag-gr: (edited)

[2019-08-08 04:39:48] <jessica.emurphy2009> Oliver without you and the people who spoke out about what was going on in Italy last year we would still be in the dark and I think things would be different in Italy. We are all fighting together no matter the base or country or AOC we fly under as we are all Ryanair pilots united in a common goal to make this place better.

[2019-08-08 07:45:43] <boston58730> Absolutely awesome video. I patiently wait for our friends in ANPAC to rejoin the fold until then I look around me at all of our sister unions and I know that we are the ones with the power.

They simply can’t close all the bases they want to close. STN, DUB, BGY, CRL, MAN do not have the slots available to reverse rotate all those flights. Even if they did, 3 of these are the bases they need to threaten anyway. 
	:+1: oliver, 737tri, lingua.fabrizio, tomflood737
[2019-08-08 08:03:29] <mischa_buijs> Muchas de nadas Fran, un abrazo! 
[2019-08-08 08:10:54] <mischa_buijs> That is class. I hope that we will be able to show  our support. 
[2019-08-08 08:38:49] <kilroyrobin> There is a natural synergy between both sides of the flight deck door. Since the BALPA earth quake started rumbling a few months ago all the pictures have started falling off the wall, I see tiles falling past the windows and management sheltering in the door frames. The whole house will come down with the slightest push at this stage. It’s the cascade effect. These cabin crew speakers are incredible. Inspirational, inspirational to all of us who work here.

[2019-08-08 08:42:36] <oliver> Thanks Jessica for the kind words 
[2019-08-08 09:59:07] <tomflood737> Excellent - threatening the jobs of 900, when it should be 1.  
[2019-08-08 10:44:55] <jorgelucca> I see it more like one plus the followers! 
[2019-08-08 11:34:18] <kilroyrobin> It seems more fair either way, I vote keep the 900 
[2019-08-08 11:42:34] <tomflood737> The followers will follow.  
[2019-08-08 12:09:17] <shane.mcmanus1693> WhatsApp rumour is that the guys in TFS and LPA where told thank you for your service, good luck. No idea how true or can someone shed some light? 
[2019-08-08 12:12:54] <albertbessler> I’m hearing the same. Sounds a bit Severe to say the least.  
[2019-08-08 12:13:44] <damiano.detomassi> With the routes still active ?  
[2019-08-08 12:18:31] <andy.airamerica> DUB, BGY and OPO Captains were all offered secondments to these bases just weeks ago. I find this whatsapp rumour hard to believe.

[2019-08-08 12:24:28] <damiano.detomassi> I heard it from a guy that was on the phone “live” with a mate there . Very specific details . Let’s assume is true . What is the legality of it ? 
[2019-08-08 12:28:11] <oliver> That is why we need to have furloughs, layoffs and base transfers procedures clearly written in the local employment contract, otherwise they will do what they want with us 
[2019-08-08 12:36:57] <remco.spelt> They have meetings in those places today and we have posted our 33 newsletter there and we will post an update (most likely in the form of another newsletter) on the <#C93GZ1GA0|ma_sepla> channel asap so everyone stay tuned and direct people to the official information there!

[2019-08-08 16:40:05] <opurry> Meetings had been taken place today. In both bases same speech. Commercial studies done about the profitability of the bases, and planned to close both bases on the 8th of January. Few possible of relocations in other bases due to pilot and cc surplus. Very bad news for all the people down here. Now let's see how true it is and the fight that we can give supported by union and it's legal assistance.

[2019-08-08 16:42:29] <boswellbrown> Did Ryanair put any of this down in writing?
I can think of only one way to face up to an intimidating bully.  
[2019-08-08 16:47:36] <boswellbrown> I’m for keeping the 300, 500 or 900.... what ever the number is.
Apparently they were doing DEC interviews yesterday?  
[2019-08-08 16:50:40] <opurry> Sure can be an intimidating strategy. It's typical in this kind of negotiations atmosphere, anything writing yet. Now we need to wait a little bit, until the SEPLA face this. I'm not a lawyer, but as far as I know, it isn't that easy to close a base, and if so isn't free either. About relocations and/or firings, no idea how it can be done. But it need to be done under Spanish work law. 
[2019-08-08 17:27:34] <brendanjacobs> Did they state the average load factor on TSF routes and the average fare? 
[2019-08-08 17:32:29] <andy.airamerica> The fact they have had to sell seats at a loss just to maintain a load factor because people lost confidence in booking with us SHOULD NOT MEAN THE STAFF HAVE TO SUFFER MANAGEMENTS MISS-MANAGEMENT. 
[2019-08-08 17:45:28] <coolhand787> Andy I agree totally with your comments. Bottom line is passengers are getting scared to use RYR to fly on their holidays more than RYR employees themselves. RYR is pushing passengers towards competitor airlines with their behavior and it’s not pilots/cc who are instrumental at this! And RYR is blaming flight crews both sides of the door for this exodus! Sounds like familiar finding scapegoats for Rostering crisis in 2018!  
[2019-08-08 17:48:12] <coolhand787> Tom I love your surgical precise and no nonsense vision! Spot on!  
[2019-08-08 18:26:56] <ginosabatino> In light of whats going on, i would suggest that we all try and refrain from doing the union busters work by spreading rumours, or even asking about rumours (as that in itself will turn into one!).

Eddie must be laughing, send a few of the children out to meet a base, and before you know it whatsapp is alive with the rumour mill and the weak or scared become more scared. 

Our sucess this time compared to the past has been because for once cross base/cross country communications has been possible, lets not turn our greatest weapon into our weakness. 

Think before you press send. Does what you are about to send help us, or would it help spread worry amongst your colleagues?

Anyway, why do people even go to these meetings?! Dont do their work for them! 

If a base is to close there is a legal process to go through, job loses are never announced by a meeting chaired by some newly hired base manager. 

Us here all know their game, but plenty others dont. (edited)

[2019-08-10 22:15:54] <kilroyrobin> “Up to 180k” why don’t they just say we earn up to a million. You don’t use the phrase ‘up to’ followed by a figure, unless you are ‘up to’ something. It’s a non descriptive denominator that makes the associated number completely meaningless. I suppose you could use it if you understood your readership to be of low cognitive power so that you could fool them, but it seems irrational here when he is addressing a group of highly skilled professionals. Imagine if we asked the fueler for ‘up to 10 tonnes please’ ... sure he might give you 5 kilos and not be wrong when he drove off. One thing I have learned in the Union game is that one of my favourite things about being a pilot is that ours is an honest profession. HR it seems is not.

[2019-08-11 07:53:19] <damiano.detomassi> Funny you posted this :

In December ‘17 i was in Chile with wife having my month off and was suppose to return in a few days .  Italy announced the strike for the 15th so I took the plane back early to partecipate with signs and sit in and all the usual . I said that exact phrase to the cabin crew onboard , who also were striking the next morning  in a general Italian aviation strike which was supposed to happen the same day . We were cheering each other .
Then after a while we  landed , The Ryanair part of the strike was called off due to announcement of union recognition from ceo . 1 week later VC first strike happened . 
Good memories .

[2019-08-11 08:12:04] <boston58730> Do people normally fill out market research questionnaires?
Do what you would normally do. I only fill out the ones which have a prize draw or which my SLACK colleagues have asked me to do. Some IALPA members did answer it and were not treated any differently than their brothers.

If that crumby email is putting the fear of MOL into people then I guess we have a lot of work to do.

[2019-08-11 08:33:25] <boston58730> Almost daily I hear requests for BALPAs legal department’s official response to this or that Tweet, e-mail, memo unofficial question etc written some middle management FR guy or whispered by BC.

Yes we can do this but legal advice costs money and resources which could be better spent elsewhere. 

Situation awareness and common sense is the hardest thing we learn as aviation professionals but once we have it, we should use it in every aspect of our lives.

I do not begrudge the 1% I pay in union subs but I would prefer it doesn’t rise to 1.5 or 2%.

If any communication is worrying members, ask your colleagues on here for advice and be sure to read said communication carefully. Usually when you RTFQ and think, the right response if any is glaringly obvious.

[2019-08-11 18:20:11] <chrisw9323> I'm new to this app and was wondering if I can get any advice regarding the pilot survey.
I am a FO based in Stansted on a Ryanair contract but still on probation.
The survey doesn't seem to have any option of 'not rostered to work, but do not wish to volunteer a day off'.
I am off the 22nd and 23rd August, my birthday is on the 23rd and I have made plans for both days.

I don't intend to strike and I am available to work days off in September.

Please could anyone give me any advice to make an informed decision of what to do next?
Thanks 
[2019-08-11 18:22:22] <grahamkendall13> Duck for cover... 
[2019-08-11 18:23:47] <grahamkendall13> But in all seriousness at least you have come to the right place 
[2019-08-11 18:37:20] <peterw.mulder> There is no legal requirement for you to complete this “survey”. 

There’s also no requirement for you to offer days off to break the strike.  
[2019-08-11 18:38:47] <peterw.mulder> If you would like me to give you a call so we can have a chat about it, feel free to email me your number at <mailto:petermulder@BALPA.org|petermulder@BALPA.org> 
[2019-08-11 18:39:25] <kilroyrobin> Contact your company council or local union rep and talk it through on the phone if this makes you more comfortable. Caution is required, however the reason I stayed in Ryanair is the 5:4 roster which the company widely boasts to be industry leading. It would not be industry leading if we were in fact considered to be on a state of permanent standby where one has to cancel plans at their whim. My off days are off days, I jam them full of plans like most people, and there is no contractual obligation for me to work on an off day, nor has anyone ever been disciplined for not answering their phone on an off day to the best of my knowledge. You are right to be cautious as you are on probation. All cabin crew who went on strike while on probation in some other states were sacked. I hope this is helpful, but you really should talk to your council. Also can I ask that you fill out your profile fully as per the instructions. We find people speak much more effectively when they are comfortable that they can identify their audience.  
[2019-08-11 18:40:44] brendancianmurphy shared file(s) FLXHNQB8A with text: Hi Chris, the same survey was sent out to Irish based pilots last year with follow up emails to our Ryanair email addresses if we had not responded. It is just fear tactics by management.

[2019-08-11 19:04:20] <healyglen> From a previous post last year ref. working days off for your information Chris.

1. Ryanair are using WOFF as a rostering tool to cover flights that otherwise would have to be cancelled. They have a shortage of crew and if they didn’t have this ‘tool’ available to them, they’d have to finally admit that there’s something intrinsically wrong with how they treat their staff and actually start working with the unions to solve the retention problems they have. 2. Usually the person working the day off, gets to choose a nice handy 2 sector day, for doing them a favour. Meanwhile his/her colleague is either put on a long 4 sector day, adding to their already long week. That handy 2 sector, might have been the only one on their roster in weeks. Or that person gets put on standby, losing out on income. 3. The council lads, some more than others, have been working on their off days for the betterment of the collective without pay and therefore have no free off days to WOFF. When they attend meetings or working groups with the company, again in pursuit of better conditions for the collective, they do it on their day off or on a work day, losing out on income otherwise earned if they were flying.
Working days off in the current climate only serves to compound the problem and makes life even harder for those trying to fix it.

You have joined BALPA and have obviously seen the benefits of what a unified pilot body can achieve. I see you are at two striper, so it is even more impressive that you have decided to engage on these important issues rather than being blissfully unaware as to what is going on like so many of our colleagues. I can only urge you to continue to find the information for yourself and the picture will become clearer the more you investigate. I guarantee you that the more you dig into what's going on, the more that you will realise that being unified with your fellow pilots is the only way forward.

[2019-08-11 20:19:57] <kilroyrobin> I was in touch with a close friend yesterday. Bitterly upset after over a decade of outstanding service, as good a Pilot as you will see in our profession anywhere. Both our families are all friends, our kids run off and play together while we older ones kick back and enjoy the chat and good company. An absolute gentleman and a lovely family to boot, but ‘to boot’ is normally a turn of phrase in a healthy society, not a greedy mindless  and heartless action to fill another man’s pocket, particularly where a young family’s lively hood are concerned. 

He has been told his base is closing and they can expect redundancies. He has a single income family and 3 children. I’m sure then it’s a thing of the past that rostering would need WOFFS worked by people or else they wouldn’t be removing my friends livelihood from him. 

Surely they are not still asking for WOFFS while laying people off, *are they?* Surely they would think people would start asking questions about the necessity for laying people off, otherwise that would be as if they expected us to help our friends loose their jobs, nobody would do that. Sure that’s bonkers. 

I have seen many crazy things in my time here but I refuse to believe they could possibly be asking pilots to cover roster shortages while others are shoved out the door along with all their invaluable experience. Sure thats madder than a bag of black widows, and who’s gonna win that game?!? Whoever wins in that bag will be bloody lonely. 

Spin that web somewhere else, that’s a losers game, and Fu@k that for a game of spiders.

[2019-08-11 21:10:54] <ginosabatino> Welcome Chris! Well done for coming to slack! 

The survey is not madatory to reply. 

There is no legal obligation to confirm to work if you are striking or not. There is a legal mechanism whereby balpa must tell ryr how many members are in each base, (no names, that’s confidential) and that is the extent of the law in UK. 

Do not reply, you have no obligation to do so. The lack of info hurts them, and will drive them to the table to talk.  
[2019-08-11 22:15:46] <paul> First of all, please do not work days off or do any other favours or anything else above and beyond the minimum necessary to fulfill your basic obligations as a professional whilst the company is threatening your colleagues (like me) with the loss of their jobs. Furthermore, please do not undermine the efforts of your BALPA colleagues to secure a decent future for you, by working days off for a company that claims it has too many staff and is threatening them with redundancy. Working days off and doing favours is something one does for an employer that reciprocates goodwill in kind, a situation we all hope to get to and one that unfortunately, due to the unreasonableness and intransigence of Ryanair's management has not so far been possible to achieve.

There is no obligation on your part to reply to any survey regarding what you will or will not do on the days of the strikes, and the advice of your union is not to respond.

Well done for being here and being part of the solution. Together, we will drag Ryanair kicking and screaming into the modern Western world where people can call sick without being bullied and intimidated, where meetings to threaten people's livelihoods are not called with a day or twos notice, and where the rule of law and basic common decency prevail.

[2019-08-12 17:48:54] <philip.ardagh> It was nice to meet you that day and talk to someone outside of DUB. Sorry I only had one. Best of luck Antoine. :+1: 
[2019-08-12 18:02:50] <antoine.chambelin> Actually was yesterday! Long earlies :-) It was nice to meet you too Philip but it would be better around a beer!  
[2019-08-12 18:26:43] <philip.ardagh> Absolutely. I'll look you up if I'm ever down your way. 
[2019-08-12 18:26:51] <kilroyrobin> Now that’s a great post, I hope anyone out there thinking about whether to wear the yellow lanyard can see from this story why one of the first things the guys from SWAPA and APA said to us in October 2017 when they came over to show support to us at the start was that we all need a way of knowing each other, a pin a badge or something. We now have the yellow lanyard thanks to that advice. Show your colleagues that you are a colleague folks, and that you are in support of the fight to protect all of us rather than just looking after yourself. (edited)
[2019-08-12 18:29:43] <antoine.chambelin> Actually Robin, I started to talk with the first crew thanks to the yellow lanyard, and Philip engaged the conversation with me when he saw the P2P badge!  
[2019-08-12 18:30:50] <antoine.chambelin> And Philip with pleasure give me a call if you pass by! 
[2019-08-12 19:13:17] <conor.mcbreen> Yellow lanyards on display today and the last few times I've jumpseated home to Dublin to see family. It's great :muscle: 
[2019-08-12 19:14:04] <kilroyrobin> Even better :+1::+1::+1::ok_hand: We must get another box of P2P badges, time to recruit.  
[2019-08-12 20:09:19] <kilroyrobin> *THE EVOLUTION OF THE YELLOW LANYARD AND WHAT IT MEANS*

*Autumn 2017* - Yellow lanyard = I’m a Union rebel and mad enough to show it.

*Christmas 2017* - Yellow lanyard = we proved we can, hell did not freeze over and we are well on the road to recognition. 

*Spring 2018* - Yellow Lanyard = Ryanair must change, I support the fight. 

*Summer 2018* - Yellow Lanyard = Ryanair must change, I am *in* the fight, (for contractors I support the fight)

*Winter 2018* - Yellow Lanyard = Ryanair’s staff have changed, we have also brought change, but we remember Eindhoven. We are not nearly done here until management change as well.  

*Spring 2019* - Yellow Lanyard = I am part of a growing and consolidating movement, growing faster than ever before. 

*Summer 2019*- Yellow Lanyard = Now they are clearly threatening to attack us. The redundancy blade is drawn. The yellow lanyard now means you support the fight to protect all of us. It means I will not idly stand aside while bases and people are threatened with dismissal during a period of predicted growth. It means you understand that together is the only way through the looming fight. 

So at the end of all this the question now is what does it mean when you choose not to wear the yellow lanyard? Well it means you are happy to look after yourself and ignore the escalating threats of unnecessary redundancies that your innocent colleagues are enduring. 

Not wearing the yellow lanyard now means that as far as you are concerned social dumping from employment contracts or preferred bases into involuntary and imposed self employed contracts in the ‘ryanair sun bin’ (who will then be forced to compete against you in mutually assured deterioration of the profession) is all fine with you just as long as it doesn’t happen to you. Trouble with that is this - it might. 

Now the good news for anyone in this category is that here in Dublin those who are our latest joiners have always been our greatest heroes. 

Last summer the round of applause and arm across the shoulders were not for the old embattled marchers, If was for those who had first joined us on a given day. The new joiners are the symbol of the growth in our stand for a fair and transparent future within the Company we have all built. 

Talk to any of us. If it’s your first time to the march, prodigal son or just not ready until now, I’ll personally walk you in the door and see you’re made welcome, I’ll walk you round the picket until you know you are among colleagues and friends . 

We are overdue the union busting memo that will seek again to instil fear about the trouble you may expect from those imaginary ‘tyre slashing union thugs’ in the car park, but you won’t find one here. You’ll find upstanding professionals who, to the last man and woman, are glad to have you there with them. 

Where would you rather be.

[2019-08-13 12:09:56] <kilroyrobin> WHO WINS IN THIS WAR OF ATTRITION 

Last year in Ireland we walked the roundabouts as a country alone for some time. 

*Last year we had sixty plus pilots on the roundabout on a given day, although our membership has grown massively since then. *

The colossal, blow delivered by so few people, against those who attack our profession was simply historic, and what is more it inspired a revolution which quickly followed. Like the ember in a storm, it would either die or turn to a blaze, but it blazed and blazed. 

*Last week a BALPA update stated they had six hundred plus pilots who were members, although I’m sure it has grown massively since then.*

That’s an increase by a factor of ten on the original sixty plus, and that’s in one country alone, but we are not alone, we are a transnational airline. 

It’s also notable that the threats in 2018 of uprooting loyal employees to the farthest corners of the network, for what even a casual observer would presume are punitive reasons, have also increased by a factor of 10 in 2019, indeed there was even a judge in Eindhoven who drew the same conclusion. 

So who is going to win this mutually escalating war of attrition? Well that is answered with a simple piece of good old extrapolation. 

If we get to 100% union support the airline will thrive. If we get to 100% of those people who are currently threatened actually getting sacked by their floundering management, then the airline will surely suffer a withering decline. 

So what if we don’t get 100% support but get a high percentage, well it’s a straight line graph, the more of us are in, the sooner the airline and it’s people can move on from this sinister and destructive chapter. Conversely, the less of us are in the more difficult this will be. 

As a company our fuel is hedged, our competition is fading, when the more sluggish or clumsy competition finally fade from the market our years of hard work and professional contributions here are set to double our airlines fortunes, let’s be a part of that. 

The answers are glaringly clear now. Let’s get this done, make this a place we can stay and thrive, and that war of attrition can ride out of town on the same horse it rode in on. (edited)

[2019-08-14 14:20:03] <greggmcavan> What was that memo about bullying and defamatory descriptions of colleagues and it not being tolerated

But it’s ok to use that term as long as it supports the company narrative 

 
[2019-08-14 14:53:04] <kilroyrobin> SO WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT?

Well we know pretty much what happens at times of potential industrial action from last year. It’s exactly what the union buster says will happen in his book. Read it, it’s almost funny it’s so accurate. However I will summarise briefly here. 

We’ve already had the threats to our jobs. 

We’ve already had senior management trying to appear more kind and human with big words like ‘I’m Sorry’ and puppy dog eyes suddenly falling in volumes straight from the pages of the union busters hand book, even after all those stark years of absence. 

Then we have already had those letters on Crewdock posted as compulsory reads again this year. Letters that bear no resemblance to actual events, but they still proclaim the terrible frustrations of a genuine and meaningful negotiating team in HQ when dealing with the terrible company councils everywhere. 

I went through the last letter with a highlighter to mark inaccuracies and straight out concocted claims. The whole page was pretty much covered by the end. Not just adjustments or economic versions of the truth, but complete ground up fabrications. 

We haven’t had the memo yet cautioning us all to come into management’s brotherly arms for support when those bruiser union thugs start lurking in the back of car parks to unleash fear and intimidation on all their hapless victims. No doubt that will appear shortly. Well I think this year it is clearer than ever exactly which side favours fear as their weapon of choice. In the Union we don’t do that ever. 

One thing we haven’t had yet is attempts to discipline, discredit and ridicule your Council, especially the leadership. 

Last year we saw personalised ridiculing of Chairman or individuals - including glaring GDPR breaches - on Crewdock, widely publicised disciplinary proceedings and so on. Pilots believe this is an intentional effort to misrepresent the council position  

These FUD plugger moves are now overdue unfortunately:- ‘ random audits’ that catch Council members for whatever can be found. Expect to see some of your Council members here or abroad being hauled in over something, or anything in the coming days and weeks. 

We council members better not use the ‘C’ word anywhere. Unlike most people a council member can get in very serious trouble for swearing as we have already seen. A copy of your bad word might even get on Crewdock for all to read before work along with 100 pages of notams, weather and briefs. Let’s not forget that 4 council members have lost their jobs in a strange spike in normal statistics since this all started. You all know your council well enough to know they are professionals, this of course makes this spike still more curious. 

I wonder will it be me? it’ll be someone I know alright. That’s always a worry I suppose for all council members, especially those who must negotiate hard on behalf of their members like the lads in there today. However we started all this to address the companies inability to retain staff, we believe and know that experienced staff increase safety margins. It seems our movement has given enough hope to Ryanair Pilots that they have indeed started to stay in Ryanair even while the fight is not yet done. 

Sure, there are less employment options in Europe than there were in 2017, but that never stopped the exodus before. People left to go anywhere, absolutely anywhere. The Ryanair Pilots drive for unionisation fixed that. 

Just remember that if they can’t catch the council they have to catch someone, otherwise the FUD system doesn’t work. This therefore is a time for absolute professionalism in every word and step that all of us take.

[2019-08-14 18:10:15] <coolhand787> DUB Wings Ceremony Update: just a heads up, met a BE based CPT who was removed from roster (3days) and invited for last week’s wings ceremony. Yet has been CPT for over 2 years!!!  :thinking_face: what purpose has this?

[2019-08-14 18:34:15] <padawa> Wonder how long that’s been going on? If it’s a new thing it’ll be so they can prove that all these new recruits we all talk about aren’t actually new at all but are backlogged wings ceremonies for crew that started years ago, sure here look at this random one here for example, sure he started 2 years ago! :man-facepalming::skin-tone-3:

[2019-08-14 19:14:22] <adamtruran> Any update on Lauda’s CLA? Weren’t they given until today to reach an agreement or they would put ryr sun planes there? Just heard from a colleague who represents Polish Cabin Crew, that they are getting ryr sun crews ready for VIE base 
[2019-08-14 19:14:51] <brendanjacobs> Lads be careful with the use of names etc.

[2019-08-14 20:39:45] kilroyrobin shared file(s) FMCB0RDGU with text: The sun exaggerates my claimed place in the world I walk by factors of two or three. It stretches my shadowy image across a sunlit ground. Standby for other shadowy characters who will now exaggerate a march of friends by factors of 2 or 3. So bold an exaggeration that many will claim it must be true, I mean you couldn’t just say that - right? Trouble is though the winter will come, the sun will set, and the shadows will grow so long that the exaggerated figure it portrays becomes clearly false. You can exaggerate forever but it doesn’t change the origin. Through all this I will focus on the origin, my family and I.

[2019-08-14 21:39:48] <ginosabatino> Having read eddies response to the irish pay claims have made me laugh.

“Unacceptable! Demanding wages of up to 172k, more than the irish pm!”

Last week we earned 200k didnt we?
