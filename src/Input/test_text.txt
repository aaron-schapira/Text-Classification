[2018-02-18 14:57:07] <tomflood737> Enda is demonstrating how *not* to reply to a Topic.
Topics should always be replied to by opening a thread like this as opposed to starting a new Topic below. It takes a while to get used to, but essential to make the most of this platform.

[2018-02-18 15:00:04] <andy.airamerica> Slack police are going to have a busy few weeks.
[2018-02-18 15:01:52] <tomflood737> It’ll take time, hopefully most will catch on. The beauty is you can always copy delete and paste it to the correct place if you forget.
[2018-02-18 15:03:00] <rpa> It was intentional so that others joining would see my post
[2018-02-18 15:04:57] <tomflood737> With you now.

[2018-02-18 16:49:52] <swfmcmanus> Is it just IALPA has this up and running or any of the other NPA?
[2018-02-18 17:03:09] <tomflood737> We are the first to kick off. The rest will follow shortly.
[2018-02-18 17:37:14] <swfmcmanus> Great, leading the way!!!
[2018-02-18 22:33:25] <tomdavies737> Hi Guys, Just want to say hello and to say "anseo". Kinda reminds me of REPA without the mug shots and the creative pseudonyms. (edited)

[2018-02-18 22:37:20] <tomflood737> Hi, Tom.
Repaweb seems like along time ago now.
I’m very hopeful that this will provide a different outcome. It’s up to each and everyone to make it happen.

---- 2018-02-19 ----
[2018-02-19 09:53:42] <tomflood737> Could all new members have a read of how we would like the profiles set up at <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions>.
This will help us out with database issues in the future.
Example
Joe Bloggs - IALPA - Capt DUB
Don’t forget to include your details in the “What I do” section. Eg LTC Ryanair or Storm etc.
Photos are important as they will help with the overall ambitions of Unity.

For those that have already set things up as required, thanks for your help.

Please read <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions> and edit names, photos, profiles etc exactly as requested. The reason for this is to aid with efficient search and database capabilities within slack.

[2018-02-20 10:10:47] <tomflood737> *Members Update*
To date we have 160 members signed up with another 50 odd pending acceptance.
There are limits to invites per acceptance, so get on to your friends who’ve yet to sign up and accept the invitation. If you know of any members who have not received an invitation, please ask them to get in touch with their NPA. For Ireland it is <mailto:ifrcc@ialpa.net|ifrcc@ialpa.net>.

Also don’t forget to check how you set up your profile. Reference instructions <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions>

[2018-02-20 21:41:08] <alessandro.zanatta737> What di you mean Tom? What's that limit you are talking about?
Last but not least, I'm still not able to reply a message, I don't find the button!!
[2018-02-20 21:47:02] <tomflood737> It’s just a restriction on members invited versus members accepting. It restricted the initial requests but I requested it to be lifted by the Slack help desk.

[2018-02-20 22:34:38] <endaryan> Folks if you click on the image you will see on the bottom “start a thread”. This is where the first person to reply to thread types. After it has been replied to once everybody else can click on the replies and it opens the “reply to thread”
So basically, to type a reply you just click on the message rather than open a new message underneath.  (edited)

[2018-02-21 01:02:03] <tomflood737> It will notify you of the restriction. I think we should be ok from now on as we’ll have a steady roll of crew accepting the invites sent out.
[2018-02-21 01:18:19] <kilroyrobin> The ones FO’s use to steal Irish maidens from innocence, your flight deck is sterile enough to have heard of no such thing I hope. But I’m afraid it’s true Tom, we both met our women by pure chance in a pub, and that makes us officially ‘old school’ to have left things to fate and random chance, whilst squandering all reasonable chance or benefit to a backdated profile pic.

[2018-02-22 14:46:12] <tomflood737> *Tip* - frequently used Channels can be "Starred". If you click on the star button on the upper left hand side the "Star" will change to yellow. Do this for frequently used Channels as they will appear on top of the left sidebar. "Slack Always Getting Slicker"
[2018-02-22 15:06:08] <padawa> Also on iPhone, when in the channel you want to star, click on channel name at the top and star is top right. Works a treat :star::+1::skin-tone-2: (edited)

	:joy: apfoley
[2018-02-22 17:18:52] <swfmcmanus> Is it possible to add "friends" on this?
[2018-02-22 17:26:55] <tomflood737> Shane this is for NPA members only. If your friend is an NPA member ask them to contact their CC. You could always setup your own Slack Team and invite your friends.
[2018-02-22 17:28:44] <swfmcmanus> I mean to add frequently contacted people to a list on the side who are already members of the RPA Slack group...
[2018-02-22 17:36:56] <tomflood737> you can direct message up to 9 including yourself and this can be a private group. Once you start private messaging they will appear at the bottom left sidebar. So if you are talking to the same people on a regular basis this is where you find them. I'll check to see if there is any other options.
[2018-02-22 17:42:35] <swfmcmanus> Perfect, thanks Tom
[2018-02-22 17:47:43] <tomflood737> Also the search function makes it easy to find people once they set up their names correctly

[2018-02-23 00:04:18] <tomflood737> *Tip* With regard to the number of Channels that exist. There’s the option to Leave a Channel that you have no interest in. The recently converted Swap Channels would be an example, where one could tidy up the left side bar.

Just open the Channel in question and click on the Title to open the Info box - select leave Channel if desired.

[2018-02-26 18:29:37] <andyappeltans> Can someone make some guidelines about sharing stuff? Every time someone replies on the anpac letter i have to go trough 6-7 threads to clear my unreads.
[2018-02-26 18:32:42] <padawa> Yea, those documents should just go straight into the relevant ma_ channel!
[2018-02-26 18:33:53] <rpa> People referring to a document should use the copy link so that its not duplicating the file
[2018-02-26 18:34:59] <andy.airamerica> I'm not sure there is a way around that Andy. For the moment its probably a good thing stuff is being shared across all bases. This way everybody gets to see it. Some people may not until they are comfortable using Slack. When people get more comfortable using this platform and know that all documents are in a specific channel then it may become unnecessary to share stuff all over the place. But for the moment its probably a good thing. (edited)
[2018-02-26 18:38:00] <rpa> Ive updated <#C94D0D9CN|02_instructions> re the copy link fucntion
[2018-02-26 18:41:50] <padawa> I'm afraid that might put people off this though, constantly reading the same thing that's been posted in every base, maybe missing out on actual new stuff, defeats the whole object of everyone having access to every channel on here. Defo the reminding about profiles etc. needs done as and when for sure, but the duplication of union material etc. could be worked on.
	:+1: dohpau, reillyfinian
[2018-02-26 18:47:18] <swfmcmanus> It's frustrating opening and closing all the base notifications for the same document... I guess it'll calm down after a few days when people get the hang of things and everyone is on the same page as where best to put things
[2018-02-26 18:50:18] <andy.airamerica> Precisely @swfmcmanus We are just a week into this, it will take a bit of time until we are professional Slackers.
[2018-02-26 18:56:36] <andyappeltans> I think the problem is when you look at the document its shared in 6 base channels, the anpac and the docs channel with #...
Its not a big thing since we are all learning how this works
[2018-02-26 19:08:14] <brendanjacobs> The document should have only been put in the relevant ma thread. The point of this is that we’re all looking into progress or updates in every base or country not just looking at our own base. If stuff is constantly duplicating like this then we won’t bother looking at any other base but our own. We’ll get used to it but the posting of the document in several places to start with, set this one off. Let’s not make the same mistake again.

[2018-02-27 07:51:56] <sam.vanherzele> The problem should be fixed as soon as everybody reads the instructions properly. An interim solution: you can ‘mute’ channels by clicking the gear icon inside each channel. You will still be able to read everything, but you will not receive notifications and it will not display in your ‘unread’ lists anymore :stuck_out_tongue:
[2018-02-27 10:25:52] <peter_mcdonough> Is there anyway to indicate unread messages alongside each channel in the channel list similar to WhatsApp?
[2018-02-27 10:30:37] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> They should be in bold, white. Or do you mean the amount of unread messages?
[2018-02-27 10:31:46] <peter_mcdonough> Just noticed that now thanks! New to slack
[2018-02-27 10:45:21] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> :+1:
[2018-02-27 11:53:47] <padawa> Documents is a 'read only' channel so there shouldn't be any comments, the ma channel is for all ma related queries etc. so post and comment away, keeps it tidy for everyone, all ma associated material and questions and answers in the one place :+1::skin-tone-2: (edited)
[2018-02-27 11:56:27] <padawa> If people post duplicate messages in all bases of a country for example it will clog up everyone's slack with notifications and will make this tool less effective :+1::skin-tone-2:
[2018-02-27 12:01:17] <padawa> Think I've worked out that when there's a new post it will show up in bold white on the channels list and then the All Threads at the top of the channels list will show all replies to posts that you have started or commented in. Still to work out tho if the bold white shows up for replies in general or just 'New posts', if that makes sense?
[2018-02-27 12:02:28] <padawa> The 'All Threads' is great tho because it shows all new replies etc. to all your conversations in the one place!
[2018-02-27 18:00:12] <kilroyrobin> A direct message or @peter_mcdonough should generate a red dot I believe.
[2018-02-27 18:03:21] <peter_mcdonough> @kilroyrobin it does indeed, thanks!

[2018-03-04 22:33:16] <kilroyrobin> THE SURVIVOR

Back in September everyone in this airline was walking down the street minding their own business. Suddenly someone realised the homeless body on the pavement was still alive.

We all rushed to the rescue, hundreds of selfless acts of bravery and determination got the old and feeble survivor on to the operating table before it was too late. As those that cared for him nursed him back to health the wise old character made a quick recovery, some of the older lads even knew his face. His name was Unity.

By December his voice could be heard far and wide, he spoke firmly, determination and wisdom in his every word, people believed and people knew he was right. Even Ryanair knew he was right, but although they turned around to the table of reason they still sat scoffing in the corner. Old habits die hard. With a sneer they played a few tricks, but he was in full recovery and it was too late. We all know the last laugh can belong to Unity - if he lives.

Just remember this though - when we rushed in and brought Unity back to life we had to save the whole man or loose his soul. Saving one little piece was no good. We must save the whole of our strength and never have it divided.

Looking after anything less than every country together is akin to putting the defibrillator on to just one limb in an attempt to save that bit for yourself. Useless.

Death peers down at old Unity from a glassy office window on high, the Angel of greed circles like a buzzard, nearby she plays a sickening tune upon a heartless harp of gold. They both wait eagerly for Unity to fall upon that very sword.

We save the whole damn lot or we save nothing. One for all and all for one might sound like a catch phrase, but in this case its the raw fact and soul of the matter.

Remember that street we were on back before September is a cul-de-sac. A dead end.

[2018-03-05 14:50:45] @andy.airamerica commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: They can’t have tried very hard to reach a solution. Adjust late schedule so that all lates finish by 22:00. If arrival time is after 22:00 due unforeseen circumstances then the runway remains open for a “grace period” in order to get all aircraft back at base so as not to affect the next days earlies. Option 2: start the maintenance at 00:00 and extend it to 05:30. This is the way it is done in almost every other airport that is carrying out runway maintenance.

[2018-03-05 15:01:37] @brendanjacobs commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: Ryanair will fight tooth and nail with an airport over a €1 increase in passenger tax, yet when it comes to something that will displace their staff.....
[2018-03-05 15:21:15] <christianklaeren> What is the deadline?
[2018-03-05 15:26:17] @christianklaeren commented on @opurrys file F9JM2MGP7: Questions which come to my mind:

1. Did they go to meetings and try to establish together with other airlines better times. Ryanair is not the only one affected.

2. Did they consider alternate island airports like TFN?

3. Is it maybe in their favor to free up pilot capacities to fill gaps elsewhere?

4. Sounds like a political game between AENA and Ryanair.
[2018-03-05 15:54:15] @andy.airamerica commented on @opurry’s file F9JM2MGP7: I'll wager its 3.

[2018-03-05 17:17:52] <fredrikallex> Hello all! Great platform we’ve got going here!

Admin, small suggestion, it may be an idea to create separate captain/fo swap groups for each base to keep swaps more relevant for each user. This might help replace whatsapp based swap groups:)
[2018-03-05 17:45:20] <andyappeltans> This has been discussed before and they are looking into it
[2018-03-05 17:47:00] <tomflood737> Fredrick, thanks for your post. Originally there were swap groups for every Base. We’ve chopped it back to Country and will adjust if needed per Country requirement. I’ve looked at some of the swap groups and there can be at least 30 posts about non swap issues between actual swaps. If this platform is used correctly, as in posters post a reply in “reply to thread” it may be ok as it is.

I realize that there’s a lot of swap activity on the FO groups as you are all suffering from zero hour contract syndrome. With Permanent jobs for all, this will be a problem of the past.

You are right we need everyone on here and WhatsApp to be a thing of the past.
[2018-03-05 17:50:12] <tomflood737> A key issue about Swaps - if you post on here you’ll have a far wider audience. You may even get a swap from OOB crew, or if sent OOB, you can look for assistance OOB.
	:+1::skin-tone-3: swfmcmanus
[2018-03-05 18:18:57] <inglo> How about a group for people in notice period and ex ryanair jockeys? With our turnover of crews that might be filling up fast :slightly_smiling_face:
	:joy: damiano.detomassi, fredrikallex
[2018-03-05 18:28:43] <fredrikallex> I see, there are definitely a lot of advantages with using slack for swaps!

I was just thinking it might be easier for them to convert if there was an equivalent /replacement to our current dedicated FO swap group. The goal here being to eventually close the whatsapp group.

Maybe the best solution would be to have swap threads based on country and rank. An OOB captain in DUB from STN can then use the Ireland CPT swap group for example. This ensures the chat is both relevant for the user and accessible to a wider (OOB) audience.


[2018-03-05 18:45:12] <padawa> Just had this forwarded.....Probably should be in Ryanair Mathematics 101, or Royal cock ups :face_with_rolling_eyes:....

Here’s a story: Edinburgh to canaries flight today, develops tech problem, 1hr to fix. Ops advises a/c change. A/c No. 2 fuelled up and crew go straight to it, paperwork brought out etc etc. On arrival crew find out it’s a 72T a/c rather than the usual 75T MTOW... aaaaand with 17T fuel they’re overweight. A/c change back to a/c No.1 and depart with delay.

Now Ops need to de-fuel a/c No2 as it’s overweight to do any flight that’s more than 3/4 full with pax... apparently it can’t be done as two Capts have been called off standby to go flying to spend a couple of hours burning off fuel! Never mind there’s a fuel shortage in Edi due to the weather :grimacing:

Certainly in its current form it is not competitive. Management drive on regardless though. They won’t pull over. They never pull over, they don’t pay people to hang around. Meanwhile the unions are at the wheel of the forklift that ultimately can fix the whole show, just as long as they are allowed to get to work before the driver rolls the whole damn thing.

[2018-03-12 20:43:45] <masterharkin> :lying_face::lying_face::lying_face::lying_face::lying_face::lying_face::lying_face::lying_face: €148,209
I have my P60.
[2018-03-12 20:49:03] <damiano.detomassi> Problem is 148209-48% becomes a second class Cpt salary . Why 48%? Cause they can’t figure out we pay in 2 different countries (apart from Irish Crew ) without any possible deduction .
[2018-03-12 20:53:22] <masterharkin> Worse for us in Ireland :flag-ie:.  40% income tax, 4% national insurance &amp; 8% universal social charge. Total 52% Tax.
[2018-03-12 20:56:09] <kilroyrobin> Yes I was just thinking the same thing. We are paying for our Sins - apparently.
[2018-03-12 21:23:15] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> I'm paying "only" 5,8% USC (yes, we pay that as well!). Is it maybe 8%, but capped?
I'm paying 10,2% over my full salary in social premiums; that's a whopping 13,3k!
And 40% income tax it not over your full salary. How much is your total tax paid devided by total income (before pension deductions, if any)? In Germany it's 48% over full income.
[2018-03-12 21:24:01] <jeroen.cornelissen.73> Anyway, happy to fund Volkswagen's fuckup, and the 150M to Air Berlin, and 4bn to a still-not-opened BER airport....
[2018-03-12 21:29:55] <damiano.detomassi> In any country the social charges take away taxable income . So 148200-12% social will become 130000 taxable , while with the current system it’s all separate entities. A normal pilot of a normally locally contracted airline will get a total deduction of tax and social of about 28-35% , we get 48-50% making any gross salary generous offer become ...shameful .  in their wisdom Europeans countries tough  about double tax treaties but not double tax / social mix treaties for Irish multinational airline employees based everywhere like us . We should start lobbying maybe ?  (edited)
[2018-03-12 23:06:16] <jgrooney> Any government is a collection activist for the global commercial elite corporations who run modern society . Power allowance is not linear , it’s vertical . Any commercial operator under that government in any country that creates employment and deducts taxes for it is a good compliant servant of the financial elite  . Therefore , we are only compliant employees that only see a tiny fraction of the benefits of loosing income to taxes . I agree..... time to stop lobbying as the higher tax payers of the new proletariat ...... namely middle class .

[2018-03-13 15:00:43] <nilsholdrinet> Bit of advice needed here guys. I'm still a contractor after 6 years and getting pretty tired of it. With the FR contracts now advertised is it advisable to go for it?  (edited)
[2018-03-13 18:59:11] <tomflood737> Nils, it’s always going to be a personal choice. If you are doing all by the book and not involved in tax evasion, it’s better on the permanent contract imho. Historically more have moved to a permanent contract than the other way given the choice. I’ve always been permanent and would not change to contract unless forced.

[2018-03-15 17:55:41] <swfmcmanus> Survey on the EFB guys... A great opportunity to tell exactly how you experience the company.

---- 2018-03-16 ----
[2018-03-16 01:05:43] <andy.airamerica> Perhaps we should wait for guidance on this from our Company Council before people start doing the survey. What use is a Ryanair survey to us? What will we gain from it if anything? We've been telling FR for 7 month what we want. It will only serve one person and that's FR.  We all know what FR mathematics are like. Should we even trust or believe any results that come out of the survey?
[2018-03-16 03:30:02] <healy.michael>  My initial reaction to P Bellew fishing for information from survey...don’t do their work for them. Whatever the survey is for, be assured it is not for your benefit.
[2018-03-16 06:46:10] <swfmcmanus> I take it as an opportunity to inform them from as many people across the network about their experiences and frustrations to date. It can be as mild as printers not working in crewrooms to how you've been screwed over with leave, base transfers last minute OOB etc. Even if they don't care about what's said in the survey and fiddle the results at least you'll have said your piece.

[2018-03-16 19:15:07] <jgrooney> With respect to all , I agree with Andy ( to see what the RYRCC say ) and with Michael . Mngt have created and fed so much distrust by now that I fear the survey is  a tactic to spin a communication to shareholders and press - outsiders , that they are actively engaging with the crew body on a regular basis . Nothing will be done as Any improvements mean cash outflow , which Mngt and shareholders ( i.e some mngt) hate . Too many holes in the dam . #fed up now as part of the pilot body trying to save the dam when they keep increasing the water levels .
[2018-03-16 21:06:48] <andy.airamerica> Excellent analogy there. They say a rising tide raises all ships. Well unfortunately the ryanair ship just has too many holes in it at the moment and not enough people have any fingers left to plug them.

[2018-03-21 22:12:15] <kilroyrobin> THE LONELINESS OF COMMAND

The Captain reads the weather and then says:-

"So I thought we could take some fuel for wind sheer, its gusting over 40”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"I thought we could change the alternate too as this one is out of limits, and we can take a bit of holding too, it’s a busy international airport, what do you think”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"so thats original block 6.6, .4 for the change of alternate, .8 for wind sheer go around, 1.2 for holding which is 8 tonnes, happy?”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"Oh wait, my mistake, that’s actually 9 tonnes”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"are you ready for a brief?”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

"…the emergency turn is turn right at 3.7 DME, left turn, back to the NDB, enter the hold 248 inbound right turns, happy with that?”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

and later

"Clear to start 2?”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

“one to go”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of PF's head as he fills in EFL)

“So thats the FRISC, Approach checks please"
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

“gear down”
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees FO’s face for the first time.)

After landing, "I have control"
“yep”
(Captain looks over, sees back of FO’s head as he fills in EFL)

Captain blames FO for this?

Nope.
